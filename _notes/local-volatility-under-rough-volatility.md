# Local volatility under rough volatility

## Abstract
Several asymptotic results for the implied volatility generated by a rough volatility model have been obtained in recent years (notably in the small-maturity regime), providing a better understanding of the shapes of the volatility surface induced by rough volatility models, supporting their calibration power to SP500 option data. Rough volatility models also generate a local volatility surface, via the so-called Markovian projection of the stochastic volatility. We complement the existing results on implied volatility by studying the asymptotic behavior of the local volatility surface generated by a class of rough stochastic volatility models, encompassing the rough Bergomi model. Notably, we observe that the celebrated "1/2 skew rule" linking the short-term at-the-money skew of the implied volatility to the short-term at-the-money skew of the local volatility, a consequence of the celebrated "harmonic mean formula" of [Berestycki, Busca, and Florent, QF 2002], is replaced by a new rule: the ratio of the at-the-money implied and local volatility skews tends to the constant 1/(H+3/2) (as opposed to the constant 1/2), where H is the regularity index of the underlying instantaneous volatility process.

## Introduction
In rough stochastic volatility models, volatility is driven by a fractional noise, in the rough regime of Hurst parameter H less than 1/2. With no claim of completeness, we mention econometric evidence [45, 40, 15], market microstructure foundations [26], efficient numerical methods and simulations schemes [11, 14, 58, 27], including deep learning algorithms [13, 47].

This work is concerned with pricing under rough volatility, a key feature of which, well-adapted to the steep volatility skews seen in Equity option markets, is the power-law behavior of the short-dated at-the-money (ATM) implied volatility skew:

$$S_{BS} \sim (\const)t^{H-1/2}$$

references include [3, 37, 6, 8, 28, 25, 38, 32, 49, 39, 12]. More specifically, we consider here - to the best of our knowledge for the first time - the Dupire local volatility [24, 23] generated by rough volatility models, using a Gyongy-type projection [51, 18] and study its short-time behavior in a large deviations regime. In the context of implied volatility, such a regime was pioneered in [28], with instantaneous stochastic volatility process given as v(t,ω) = σ(W^H_t (ω)), i.e., as some explicit function of a fractional Brownian motion (fBm). In particular, no rough or Volterra stochastic differential equations need to be solved. We shall work under the same structural assumption as [28], although under less restrictive growth assumptions, such as to include the popular rough Bergomi model where σ has exponential form.

Postponing detailed recalls and precise definitions, our main result (Theorem 3.3) states that,

$$\sigma_{loc}(t, y t^{1/2-H}) \to \sigma(\hat{h}_y^1) \ast \downarrow 0,$$

where ˆh_y is related to a minimization problem, similar to a geodesic in Riemannian geometry. Our analytic understanding is sufficiently fine to exploit it on the one hand for numerical tests (discussed in Section 4) and on the other hand to derive further analytic results (formulated in Sections 2 and 3, with proofs left to Section 5) including the blowup, when H < 1/2, of the local volatility skew in the short-dated limit,

$$S_{loc} \sim (\const)t^{H-1/2},$$

see Corollary 3.4 below for a precise statement and information on the constant. This finding is consistent with [38] where it is shown, amongst others, that in "regular" local-stochastic vol models, which amounts to a regularity assumption on σ_loc, the implied volatility skew does not explode. The regularity of σ_loc is violated here in the sense that S_loc is infinite at t = 0. This is also consistent with [60, 36] where it is shown that a "singular" σ_loc can indeed produce exploding implied skews.

A further interesting consequence, also part of Corollary 3.4, is then that the 1/2-rule of thumb from practitioners [22] (see also [43] and [39, Remark 3.4] for different proofs) actually fails and is replaced, again in the short-dated limit, by what we may call the 1/(H+3/2)-rule,

$$S_{BS} / S_{loc} \to 1/(H+3/2).$$

As a sanity check, for Hurst parameter H = 1/2 we are in a diffusive regime and then indeed fall back to the 1/2-rule.

## The modeling framework
We assume S_0 = 1 and that the log price X_t := log S_t satisfies

$$dX_t = -1/2 V_t dt + \sqrt{V_t} (\rho dW_t + \rho dW_t)$$

V_t = σ^2(W^H_t)

with 'volatility function' σ: R → R. We shall assume σ to be smooth, subject to mild growth conditions given below, such as to cover rough Bergomi type situations where σ(x) = σ_0 exp(ηx).

### Assumption 2.1
There exist c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 > 0 such that for all x ∈ R,

$$c_1 e^{-c_2 |x|} \leq \sigma(x),$$

$$\sigma(x) \leq c_3 e^{c_4 |x|}.$$

We take ρ^2 + ρ^2 = 1, with ρ ∈ (-1,1). We denote W = (W, W) where W, W are two independent standard Brownian motions. These are used to construct W^H_t = (K * ˙W)_t, with

$$K(t,s) = \sqrt{2H}(t-s)^{H-1/2} \mathbf{1}_{t>s}$$

so that W^H is a Riemann–Liouville fBm with Hurst index H ≤ 1/2.

## Mathematical setting and results
The time-scaling property of the Gaussian process (W, W, W^H) underlying the model (2.1) yields X^ε_2 law = X^ε_1 for every ε > 0, where X^ε_1 satisfies

$$X^ε_1 = \int_1^0 σ(ε^{2H} W^H_s) ε ds (ρ dW_s + ρ dW_s) - 1/2 ε^2 \int_1^0 σ^2(ε^{2H} W^H_s) ds.$$

Forde and Zhang proved in [28], albeit under different technical conditions on the volatility function, that a small noise Large Deviation Principle (LDP) holds for the family ε^{2H-1} X^ε_1 (hence for ε^{2H-1} X^ε_2) as ε → 0, with speed ε^{4H} and rate function

$$Λ(y) := \inf_{h=(h,h) \in H_1} \{1/2 \|h\|_{H_1}^2 : \int_t^0 σ(\hat{h}_s) (ρ dh_s + ρ dh_s) = y\} = 1/2 \|h_y\|_{H_1}^2,$$

where h_y is a minimizer of the control problem defining Λ(y). From the LDP (3.2), we have

$$-ε^{4H} \log P(X^ε_1 \geq y ε^{1-2H}) \to Λ(y) = 1/2 \|h_y\|_{H_1}^2, y > 0 as ε ↓ 0,$$

$$-ε^{4H} \log P(X^ε_1 \leq y ε^{1-2H}) \to Λ(y) = 1/2 \|h_y\|_{H_1}^2, y < 0 as ε ↓ 0.$$

The short-time result for call and put prices reads as follows (see [28, Corollary 4.13])

$$-t^{2H} \log E[(e^{X_t} - e^{y t^{1/2-H}})^+] \to Λ(y) = 1/2 \|h_y\|_{H_1}^2, y > 0 as t ↓ 0,$$

$$-t^{2H} \log E[(e^{y t^{1/2-H}} - e^{X_t})^+] \to Λ(y) = 1/2 \|h_y\|_{H_1}^2, y < 0 as t ↓ 0.$$

Let us also recall that these option price asymptotics imply the following asymptotic formula for the Black–Scholes implied volatility (notation: σ_BS), which can be seen as a "rough" version of the Berestycki–Buscat–Florent (BBF) formula [17]:

$$σ_{BS}^2 (t, y t^{1/2-H}) \to χ^2(y) := y^2 / (2Λ(y)), y \neq 0 as t ↓ 0.$$

## Markovian projection at the LDP regime
The Markovian projection of the instantaneous variance V_t within the model (2.1) is defined by

$$σ_{loc}^2 (t,k) := E[V_t | X_t = k]$$

for every t > 0 and k ∈ R.

We now present our main result. We prove that the local volatility function (3.8) satisfies the following short-time asymptotics.

### Theorem 3.3 (Markovian projection at the LDP regime)
Let Assumption 2.1 be in force. Then, the Markovian projection in the model (2.1) satisfies, for every y ∈ R\{0} small enough,

$$σ_{loc}^2 (t, y t^{1/2-H}) \to σ^2 (\hat{h}_y^1) as t ↓ 0,$$

where we recall that \hat{h}_y^t = \int_t^0 K(t,s) dh_y^s and h_y = (h_y, h_y) is the minimizer of the rate function in (3.2).

## Local volatility skew and the new 1/(H+3/2) rule
Let us write ∼ for asymptotic equivalence as t → 0. Let us denote Σ(y) := σ(\hat{h}_y^1) the limiting function in (3.9), and consider the following finite-difference approximations of the local and implied volatility skew

$$S_{loc}(t,y) := \frac{σ_{loc}(t, y t^{1/2-H}) - σ_{loc}(t, -y t^{1/2-H})}{2 y t^{1/2-H}},$$

$$S_{BS}(t,y) := \frac{σ_{BS}(t, y t^{1/2-H}) - σ_{BS}(t, -y t^{1/2-H})}{2 y t^{1/2-H}}.$$

Then, we have the following

### Corollary 3.4 (Local vol skew and the new 1/(H+3/2) rule)
Let ρ ≠ 0. Let Assumption 2.1 be in force. Then, for y ∈ R\{0} small enough,

$$S_{loc}(t,y) ∼ \frac{Σ(y) - Σ(-y)}{2y} \frac{1}{t^{1/2-H}} as t → 0.$$

Under the additional moment condition in Assumption 3.2,

$$S_{BS}(t,y) / S_{loc}(t,y) \to \frac{1}{H+3/2} as t → 0.$$

In the case ρ = 0, we have S_BS(t,y) = 0 and S_loc(t,y) = 0 for every t.

## Numerical tests
We wish to estimate the conditional expectation (3.8) for some specific instance of the model (2.1), using Monte Carlo simulation. We consider the rough Bergomi model [6], for which the instantaneous variance process is given by

$$V_t = ξ_0 \exp(η W^H_t - η^2/2 t^{2H})$$

where ξ_0 = V_0 is the spot variance and η a parameter that tunes the volatility of variance.

For a given time horizon T > 0 and a number N ∈ N^* of time-steps, the random vector (log V_t_k)_{1≤k≤N}, t_k = k T/N, has a multivariate Gaussian distribution with known mean and variance, see for example [6], and can therefore be simulated exactly. We use the standard simulation method for Gaussian vectors based on a Cholesky factorization of the covariance matrix.

We construct approximate samples of the log-asset price X_T = -1/2 ∫_T^0 V_t dt + ∫_T^0 √V_t (ρ dW_t + ρ dW_t) using a forward Euler scheme on the same time-grid.

We use M = 1.5 × 10^6 Monte Carlo samples and N = 500 discretization points.

### Remark 4.1
Several recent works [10, 9, 42, 30] study the weak error rate of rough Bergomi type models. Without going into (bibliographical) details, the weak rate has now been identified as 1 for H above 1/6 and 3H + 1/2 for H below 1/6. Importantly, as H ↓ 0, a weak rate of 1/2 persists. The fairly large number of time steps we considered in our experiments (N = 500) is arguably enough to obtain good benchmark values when H is close to 1/2, but we should bear in mind that the bias in the Monte Carlo estimation is expected to become more and more important as H approaches zero. In this case, larger number of time steps might be required to get a trustworthy level of accuracy; of course, the complexity of the exact Cholesky method we exploited in our simulation of the Riemann–Liouville process makes the simulations very demanding for very large values of N.

## Short-dated local volatility
Theorem 3.3 gives the asymptotic behavior of σ_loc(t, y t^{1/2-H}) as t becomes small. Since y is allowed to vary around the at-the-money point y = 0, we can check whether the limit (3.9) holds for the function y ↦ ˆσ_loc(t,y) := σ_loc(t, y t^{1/2-H}), that is the whole local volatility smile rescaled with maturity.

The computation of the limiting function σ(\hat{h}_y^1) requires us to evaluate the Cameron-Martin path h_y ∈ H_1 that minimizes the rate function in (3.2), for given y. We follow the procedure already exploited in [28] and [32, section 5.1]: it can be shown, see [28], that the rate function satisfies the alternative representation Λ(y) = inf { (y - ρ G(h))^2 / (2ρ^2 F(h)) + 1/2 ⟨˙h, ˙h⟩ : ˙h ∈ L^2(0,1) }, with F(h) = ⟨σ^2(\hat{h}), 1⟩ = ∫_1^0 σ^2(\hat{h}_t) dt and G(h) = ⟨σ(\hat{h}), ˙h⟩ = ∫_1^0 σ(\hat{h}_t) ˙h_t dt. This alternative representation yields the rate function under the form of an unconstrained optimization problem (as opposed to the constrained optimization in (3.2)), which can then be approximately solved by the projection of the one-dimensional path h over an orthonormal basis {˙e_n}_{n≥1} of L^2,

˙h_t = ∑_{n≥1} a_n ˙e_n(t).

In practice, we truncate the sum at a certain order N and minimize over the coefficients (a_n)_{1≤n≤N}; we obtain an approximation of the minimizer h_y and therefore of \hat{h}_y^t = (K^H * ˙h_y)_t = ∫_t^0 K(t,s) ˙h_y^s ds. We chose the Fourier basis {˙e_1(t) = 1, ˙e_2n(t) = √2 cos(2πnt), ˙e_2n+1(t) = √2 sin(2πnt), n ∈ N\{0}} in our experiments, and observed that truncation of the sum at N = 8 provides a good accuracy.

The results for the rough Bergomi model are displayed in Figure 3, where the function ˆσ_loc(t,y) is indeed seen to approach its limit σ(\hat{h}_y^1) when maturity decreases from T = 0.5 to T = 0.05. The residual error term ˆσ_loc(t,y) - σ(\hat{h}_y^1) is seen to depend on H, with lower values of H being associated with higher errors. It is however unclear whether the error for H = 0.1 is due to the slow convergence of ˆσ_loc or the weak error rate due to the Monte Carlo simulation (see Remark 4.1).

## Extrapolation of local volatility surfaces
Theorem 3.3 provides us with an extrapolation recipe of local volatilities for very short maturities: fixing a (small) maturity T and a log-moneyness level k, formally plugging y = k / T^{1/2-H} in (3.9) we obtain

$$σ_{loc}(T, k) ≈ σ(\hat{h}_y^1) |_{y = k / T^{1/2-H}}.$$

The limiting function σ(\hat{h}_y^1) |_{y = k / T^{1/2-H}} can therefore be used to extrapolate a local volatility surface in a way that is consistent with the behavior implied by a rough volatility model.

As a specific application, consider the calibration of a local-stochastic volatility model (LSV) to an option price surface, for example using the particle method of Guyon and Henry-Labordère [50]. The LSV model calibrated to a given Dupire local volatility surface σ_Dup, corresponds to (see [50])

$$l(t,S_t) = \frac{σ_{Dup}(t,S_t)}{\sqrt{E[V_t | S_t]}}.$$

In general, one wishes the leverage function l(t,·) to be a small correction to the original stochastic volatility model (in other words: as close as possible to l ≡ 1). In practice, the local volatility σ_Dup coming from market data has to be extrapolated for values of t smaller than the shorter observed maturity, and the choice of the extrapolation method is up to the user. If, for small t, the chosen extrapolation σ_Dup(t,K) is qualitatively too different from the behavior of the conditional expectation E[V_t | S_t = K] in the rough volatility setting (for example, more specifically: the ATM skew of σ_Dup is far from the power law (3.12)), then the leverage function will have to compensate, hence deviating from the unit function. Under the pure rough volatility model (l ≡ 1), Theorem 3.3 and Corollary 3.4 describe the behavior of the Markovian projection E[V_t | S_t] for small t: eventually, these statements give hints on how σ_Dup(t,·) should be extrapolated for l(t,·) not to deviate too much from the unit function. Such an extrapolation scheme is exploited in the recent work of Dall'Acqua, Longoni and Pallavicini [19], precisely in order to calibrate a LSV model with lifted Heston [1] backbone to the implied volatility surface of the EuroStoxx50 index.

## Failure of the harmonic mean asymptotic formula under rough volatility
In Remark 3.7, we pointed out that, as a consequence of the general 1/(H+3/2) skew rule (as opposed to the 1/2 rule) in Corollary 3.4, the harmonic mean asymptotic formula σ_BS(T,k) ∼ H(T,k) as T → 0, see (3.16), is expected not to hold for H ≠ 1/2 (without any contradiction with the statements in [16], which require regularity conditions on local volatility surface that are not satisfied in the rough volatility setting, see our discussion in Remark 3.7). In other words, we do not expect the harmonic mean of the local volatility H(T,k) = 1/(1/k ∫_k^0 dy σ_loc(T,y)) to be a good approximation of the implied volatility smile when maturities become small when the involved volatility surfaces are generated by a rough vol model. Having constructed estimators (4.3) and (4.4) of the local volatility function under the rough Bergomi model, we are also able to approximate (with an additional deterministic quadrature) the harmonic mean H(T,k), and compare the output with the implied volatility smile.

The results are shown in Figure 4, for three different values of H. As expected, when H = 0.5 we observe (upper left panel) that the implied volatility σ_BS(T,k) approaches the harmonic mean H(T,k) when maturity decreases from T = 0.45 to T = 0.05, and the at-the-money slopes are also seen to agree. The convergence is even more apparent in the upper right figure, where the ratio σ_BS(T,k)/H(T,k) is seen to monotonically converge to one. This behavior should be compared with the one in the two bottom figures, where the rough case H = 0.1 is considered (the case H = 0.3 being intermediate between the other two): now, when maturity decreases, the implied volatility smile does not seem to approach the harmonic mean H(T,k) anymore (apart from the specific at-the-money point k = 0 where both functions tend to the initial spot volatility σ_0 = √V_0), and in particular, the slopes of the two curves are seen to considerably deviate from each other. This phenomenon is even more clear in the bottom right figure, where the ratio σ_BS(T,k)/H(T,k) has a completely different behavior with respect to the diffusive case H = 0.5.
