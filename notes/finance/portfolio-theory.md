# Modern Portfolio Theory

## Efficient Frontier

The efficient frontier represents the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk.

## Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

$$E[R_i] = R_f + \beta_i(E[R_m] - R_f)$$

Where:
- $E[R_i]$ = Expected return of asset $i$
- $R_f$ = Risk-free rate
- $\beta_i$ = Beta of asset $i$
- $E[R_m]$ = Expected market return

## Portfolio Optimization

### Minimum Variance Portfolio
$$\min \sigma_p^2 = \mathbf{w}^T \Sigma \mathbf{w}$$
Subject to $\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{1} = 1$

Where $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix and $\mathbf{w}$ is the weight vector.
