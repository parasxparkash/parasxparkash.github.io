The study reveals a linear relationship between order flow imbalance and price changes, with a slope inversely proportional to market depth. This model explains the empirically observed \"square-root\" relationship between price changes and trading volume while demonstrating that order flow imbalance is a more robust predictor than trade-based measures.\r\n\r\n## 1. Introduction\r\n\r\nThe availability of high-frequency trading data has enabled detailed investigation of how order flow affects prices in order-driven markets. Understanding price impact is crucial for optimal execution strategies and market microstructure theory.\r\n\r\n### 1.1 Key Findings Summary\r\n\r\nThe research introduces **Order Flow Imbalance (OFI)** as a comprehensive measure that captures supply/demand dynamics through all order book events. Key results include:\r\n\r\n- Linear relationship between OFI and price changes with R² averaging 65%\r\n- Price impact coefficient inversely related to market depth\r\n- OFI explains price movements better than traditional trade-based measures\r\n- Intraday patterns in price impact linked to market depth fluctuations\r\n\r\n## 2. Order Flow Imbalance: The Core Concept\r\n\r\n### 2.1 Variable Definition\r\n\r\nThe study focuses on Level I order book data, examining the best bid and ask prices and quantities:\r\n\r\n- **Bid side**: Price $P^B$ and size $q^B$ (demand)\r\n- **Ask side**: Price $P^A$ and size $q^A$ (supply)\r\n\r\nFor each order book event $n$, the contribution $e_n$ to order flow imbalance is defined as:\r\n\r\n$$e_n = I_{\\{P^B_n \\geq P^B_{n-1}\\}} q^B_n - I_{\\{P^B_n \\leq P^B_{n-1}\\}} q^B_{n-1} - I_{\\{P^A_n \\leq P^A_{n-1}\\}} q^A_n + I_{\\{P^A_n \\geq P^A_{n-1}\\}} q^A_{n-1}$$\r\n\r\nwhere $I$ represents indicator functions.\r\n\r\n### 2.2 Order Flow Imbalance Calculation\r\n\r\nThe order flow imbalance over time interval $[t_{k-1}, t_k]$ is:\r\n\r\n$$OFI_k = \\sum_{n=N(t_{k-1})+1}^{N(t_k)} e_n$$\r\n\r\nThis variable:\r\n- **Increases** when bid size increases, ask size decreases, or bid/ask prices rise\r\n- **Decreases** when bid size decreases, ask size increases, or bid/ask prices fall\r\n\r\nCritically, OFI treats market orders and cancellations equivalently when they have the same net effect on queue sizes.\r\n\r\n## 3. Theoretical Framework\r\n\r\n### 3.1 Stylized Order Book Model\r\n\r\nThe theoretical foundation assumes:\r\n1. Depth $D$ shares at each price level beyond best bid/ask\r\n2. Limit orders and cancellations occur only at best prices\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions, price changes follow:\r\n\r\nFor bid side: $\\Delta P^b = \\lfloor (L^b - C^b - M^s)/D \\rfloor$\r\n\r\nFor ask side: $\\Delta P^a = -\\lfloor (L^s - C^s - M^b)/D \\rfloor$\r\n\r\nTaking the average (mid-price):\r\n\r\n$$\\Delta P = \\frac{OFI}{2D} + \\epsilon$$\r\n\r\nwhere $\\epsilon$ represents truncation error.\r\n\r\n### 3.2 Empirical Model Specification\r\n\r\nThe real-world implementation uses:\r\n\r\n$$\\Delta P_k = \\beta \\cdot OFI_k + \\epsilon_k$$\r\n\r\nwhere $\\beta$ is the price impact coefficient and $\\epsilon_k$ captures noise from deeper order book levels.\r\n\r\nThe price impact coefficient varies with market depth:\r\n\r\n$$\\beta_i = \\frac{c}{AD_i^\\lambda} + \\nu_i$$\r\n\r\nwhere:\r\n- $AD_i$ is average depth during interval $[T_{i-1}, T_i]$\r\n- $c$ and $\\lambda$ are constants\r\n- $\\nu_i$ is a noise term\r\n\r\n$$AD_i = \\frac{1}{2(N(T_i) - N(T_{i-1}) - 1)} \\sum_{n=N(T_{i-1})+1}^{N(T_i)} (q^B_n + q^A_n)$$\r\n\r\n## 4. Empirical Results\r\n\r\n### 4.1 Data and Methodology\r\n\r\nThe analysis uses NYSE TAQ data from April 2010 for 50 randomly selected S&P 500 stocks, aggregated over 10-second intervals.\r\n\r\n### 4.2 Linear Relationship Evidence\r\n\r\nThe regression model:\r\n\r\n$$\\Delta P_k = \\hat{\\alpha}_i + \\hat{\\beta}_i OFI_k + \\hat{\\epsilon}_k$$\r\n\r\nResults show:\r\n- Average R² of 65% across all stocks\r\n- Price impact coefficient $\\hat{\\beta}_i$ statistically significant in 97% of samples\r\n- Intercept mostly insignificant, supporting the linear model\r\n\r\n### 4.3 Depth-Impact Relationship\r\n\r\nParameter estimation through log-linear regression:\r\n\r\n$$\\log \\hat{\\beta}_i = \\hat{\\alpha}_{L,i} - \\hat{\\lambda} \\log AD_i + \\hat{\\epsilon}_{L,i}$$\r\n\r\nThen linear regression:\r\n\r\n$$\\hat{\\beta}_i = \\hat{\\alpha}_{M,i} + \\frac{\\hat{c}}{AD_i^{\\hat{\\lambda}}} + \\hat{\\epsilon}_{M,i}$$\r\n\r\nKey findings:\r\n- $\\hat{\\lambda} \\approx 1$ for most stocks, confirming inverse relationship\r\n- Average R² of 74% for the depth-impact relationship\r\n- Parameter $c$ varies across stocks but $\\lambda = 1$ is generally supported\r\n\r\n## 5. Intraday Patterns and Market Dynamics\r\n\r\n### 5.1 Seasonality in Price Impact\r\n\r\nThe link between price impact and market depth explains intraday volatility patterns:\r\n\r\n$$\\text{var}[\\Delta P_k]_i = \\beta_i^2 \\text{var}[OFI_k]_i + \\text{var}[\\epsilon_k]_i$$\r\n\r\nObservations:\r\n- Market depth is lowest (highest price impact) at market open\r\n- Price impact is 5× higher at open compared to close\r\n- Order flow imbalance volatility peaks at market close\r\n\r\n### 5.2 Information Asymmetry Interpretation\r\n\r\nThe model provides an observable explanation for intraday volatility patterns previously attributed to unobservable information asymmetry. Low depth at market open may indicate limit order traders' awareness of information asymmetry, creating higher price impact that makes information advantages harder to realize.\r\n\r\n## 6. Trade Impact vs. Order Flow Impact\r\n\r\n### 6.1 Comparative Analysis\r\n\r\nTrade imbalance during interval $[t_{k-1}, t_k]$:\r\n\r\n$$TI_k = \\sum_{n=N(t_{k-1})+1}^{N(t_k)} b_n - \\sum_{n=N(t_{k-1})+1}^{N(t_k)} s_n$$\r\n\r\nwhere $b_n$ and $s_n$ are buy and sell trade sizes.\r\n\r\nRegression comparisons:\r\n1. $\\Delta P_k = \\hat{\\alpha}_i + \\hat{\\beta}_i OFI_k + \\hat{\\epsilon}_k$ (R² = 65%)\r\n2. $\\Delta P_k = \\hat{\\alpha}_{T,i} + \\hat{\\beta}_{T,i} TI_k + \\hat{\\epsilon}_{T,k}$ (R² = 32%)\r\n3. $\\Delta P_k = \\hat{\\alpha}_{D,i} + \\hat{\\theta}_{O,i} OFI_k + \\hat{\\theta}_{T,i} TI_k + \\hat{\\epsilon}_{D,k}$\r\n\r\nResults demonstrate:\r\n- OFI explains price movements more effectively than trade imbalance\r\n- Trade imbalance becomes statistically insignificant when combined with OFI\r\n- Trade effects are adequately captured within the broader OFI measure\r\n\r\n## 7. Volume-Price Relationship: A Statistical Artifact\r\n\r\n### 7.1 Scaling Relationship Theory\r\n\r\n**Proposition 1**: Under assumptions of:\r\n1. Events accumulate at rate $\\Lambda$: $N(T)/T \\to \\Lambda$\r\n2. Event contributions $\\{e_i\\}$ are i.i.d. with variance $\\sigma^2$\r\n3. Trade sizes $\\{w_i\\}$ are i.i.d. with mean $\\mu\\pi$\r\n\r\nThen:\r\n$$\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mu\\pi}}{\\sigma} \\frac{OFI(T)}{\\sqrt{VOL(T)}} \\Rightarrow \\xi \\sim N(0,1)$$\r\n\r\n### 7.2 Implications for Volume-Price Relations\r\n\r\nThis scaling leads to the apparent relationship:\r\n\r\n$$\\Delta P_k = \\theta_k \\sqrt{VOL_k} + \\epsilon_k$$\r\n\r\nwhere $\\theta_k = \\beta_i \\xi_k \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\mu\\pi}}$ is a random normal variable.\r\n\r\nMore generally:\r\n$$\\Delta P_k = \\theta_k VOL_k^H + \\epsilon_k$$\r\n\r\nEmpirical analysis shows:\r\n- Exponent $H$ varies considerably across stocks and time\r\n- $H$ generally below 0.5 in the data\r\n- Volume relationship becomes insignificant after controlling for OFI\r\n\r\n## 8. Robustness and Extensions\r\n\r\n### 8.1 Timescale Analysis\r\n\r\nThe model remains robust across different time aggregations (10 quote updates to 10 minutes), with fit quality generally increasing with aggregation interval.\r\n\r\n### 8.2 Nonlinear Terms\r\n\r\nAdding quadratic terms $\\hat{\\gamma}_{Q,i} OFI_k |OFI_k|$ provides minimal improvement:\r\n- R² increases from 65% to 68%\r\n- Quadratic coefficient statistically insignificant in most samples\r\n\r\n### 8.3 Transaction Price Analysis\r\n\r\nAnalysis using transaction prices instead of mid-prices confirms:\r\n- OFI remains more explanatory than trade imbalance\r\n- Some evidence of concave relationships in trade-time sampling\r\n- Sampling biases may explain nonlinear patterns in transaction-based studies\r\n\r\n## 9. Practical Implications\r\n\r\n### 9.1 Algorithmic Trading\r\n\r\nThe linear OFI model provides a parsimonious framework for:\r\n- Real-time price impact estimation\r\n- Optimal execution algorithm design\r\n- Risk management in high-frequency strategies\r\n\r\n### 9.2 Market Making\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the depth-impact relationship helps market makers:\r\n- Adjust pricing based on observable market depth\r\n- Anticipate impact during different market sessions\r\n- Optimize inventory management strategies\r\n\r\n## 10. Limitations and Future Research\r\n\r\n### 10.1 Model Limitations\r\n\r\n- Focus on Level I data excludes deeper order book information\r\n- Hidden orders not captured in analysis\r\n- Assumes simplified order book structure\r\n\r\n### 10.2 Future Directions\r\n\r\n- Extension to multiple asset classes\r\n- Investigation of cross-asset spillover effects\r\n- Integration with machine learning approaches\r\n- Analysis of market stress periods\r\n\r\n## 11. Conclusion\r\n\r\nThis research establishes order flow imbalance as a superior measure for understanding high-frequency price formation compared to traditional trade-based metrics. The linear relationship between OFI and price changes, mediated by market depth, provides a robust and parsimonious model that explains intraday volatility patterns using observable quantities rather than unobservable parameters like information asymmetry.\r\n\r\nThe findings suggest that price impact is fundamentally driven by supply-demand imbalances at the best quotes, with the magnitude of impact determined by available liquidity. This framework offers practical insights for algorithmic trading, optimal execution, and market microstructure understanding while demonstrating that the widely-observed volume-price relationship may be largely a statistical artifact of data aggregation rather than a fundamental market phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity and robustness of the OFI model across stocks and time scales make it a valuable tool for both theoretical understanding and practical application in modern electronic markets.\r\n",

Understanding how individual orders affect stock prices—known as price impact—is crucial for traders, market makers, and regulators alike. This understanding directly influences optimal trading strategies, market liquidity provision, and regulatory oversight of fair and efficient markets.\r\n\r\nTraditional approaches to studying price impact have primarily focused on completed trades, examining how the size and direction of executed transactions relate to subsequent price movements. However, this perspective overlooks a fundamental aspect of modern electronic markets: the vast majority of market activity occurs through limit orders that sit in the order book, providing liquidity and depth to the market. Between every two trades, dozens of quote updates may occur as market participants adjust their limit orders, cancel existing orders, or submit new ones.\r\n\r\nThis research by Cont, Kukanov, and Stoikov (2011) introduces a revolutionary approach to understanding price impact by focusing on order flow imbalance—a comprehensive measure that captures the net effect of all order book events, including market orders, limit orders, and cancellations. Their findings suggest that price formation is fundamentally driven by changes in the balance between supply and demand at the best bid and ask prices, rather than by trading volume alone.\r\n\r\n## Theoretical Framework\r\n\r\n### Order Book Structure and Dynamics\r\n\r\nModern equity markets operate as order-driven systems where participants submit limit orders specifying prices and quantities they are willing to trade. The order book aggregates these orders, with the highest bid (buy order) and lowest ask (sell order) forming the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO). The sizes of orders at these best prices represent the immediate liquidity available to market participants.\r\n\r\nAt any given time, the order book state can be characterized by four key variables:\r\n- $P^B$: Best bid price\r\n- $q^B$: Total quantity available at the best bid\r\n- $P^A$: Best ask price  \r\n- $q^A$: Total quantity available at the best ask\r\n\r\n### Defining Order Flow Imbalance\r\n\r\nThe central innovation of this research lies in the definition of order flow imbalance (OFI), which quantifies the net change in supply and demand at the best quotes. For each order book event $n$, the contribution to order flow imbalance is:\r\n\r\n$$e_n = I_{\\{P^B_n \\geq P^B_{n-1}\\}} q^B_n - I_{\\{P^B_n \\leq P^B_{n-1}\\}} q^B_{n-1} - I_{\\{P^A_n \\leq P^A_{n-1}\\}} q^A_n + I_{\\{P^A_n \\geq P^A_{n-1}\\}} q^A_{n-1}$$\r\n\r\nWhere $I_{\\{\\cdot\\}}$ denotes the indicator function. This formulation captures several intuitive principles:\r\n\r\n1. **Bid-side contributions are positive**: When bid prices increase or bid quantities increase, this represents increased demand and contributes positively to OFI\r\n2. **Ask-side contributions are negative**: When ask prices decrease or ask quantities increase, this represents increased supply and contributes negatively to OFI\r\n3. **Symmetric treatment**: A market sell order removing shares from the bid has the same OFI impact as a limit order cancellation removing the same number of shares\r\n\r\nThe aggregate order flow imbalance over a time interval $[t_{k-1}, t_k]$ is then:\r\n\r\n$$OFI_k = \\sum_{n=N(t_{k-1})+1}^{N(t_k)} e_n$$\r\n\r\nWhere $N(t)$ represents the number of events up to time $t$.\r\n\r\n### The Linear Price Impact Model\r\n\r\nThe core hypothesis of this research is that mid-price changes respond linearly to order flow imbalance:\r\n\r\n$$\\Delta P_k = \\beta \\cdot OFI_k + \\varepsilon_k \\quad \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}$$\r\n\r\nWhere:\r\n- $\\Delta P_k = (P_k - P_{k-1})/\\delta$ represents mid-price changes in ticks over interval $[t_{k-1}, t_k]$\r\n- $\\beta$ is the price impact coefficient\r\n- $\\varepsilon_k$ is a noise term capturing effects from deeper order book levels and rounding errors\r\n\r\nThis linear specification contrasts sharply with traditional models that propose nonlinear (often square-root) relationships between price changes and trade characteristics.\r\n\r\n### Theoretical Justification: Stylized Order Book Model\r\n\r\nTo provide theoretical grounding for the linear relationship, the authors develop a stylized order book model with two key assumptions:\r\n\r\n1. **Uniform depth**: Each price level beyond the best bid/ask contains exactly $D$ shares\r\n2. **Concentrated activity**: Limit orders and cancellations occur only at the best bid/ask levels\r\n\r\nUnder these assumptions, consider the impact of order book events on bid and ask prices separately. When the net effect of all events removes $X$ shares from the bid side, the bid price must drop by $\\lfloor X/D \\rfloor$ ticks to maintain market equilibrium. Similarly for the ask side.\r\n\r\nFor the bid price: $\\Delta P^b = \\lfloor(L^b - C^b - M^s)/D \\rfloor$\r\n\r\nFor the ask price: $\\Delta P^a = -\\lfloor(L^s - C^s - M^b)/D \\rfloor$\r\n\r\nWhere $L^b, L^s$ represent limit buy/sell orders, $C^b, C^s$ represent cancelled buy/sell orders, and $M^s, M^b$ represent market sell/buy orders.\r\n\r\nTaking the average to obtain mid-price changes:\r\n\r\n$$\\Delta P = \\frac{OFI}{2D} + \\varepsilon \\quad \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}$$\r\n\r\nThis stylized model yields a linear relationship between price changes and order flow imbalance, with the slope inversely proportional to market depth $D$.\r\n\r\n### Relationship Between Price Impact and Market Depth\r\n\r\nWhile real order books deviate significantly from the stylized model's assumptions, the inverse relationship between price impact and depth should still hold. The authors propose:\r\n\r\n$$\\beta_i = \\frac{c}{AD_i^\\lambda} + \\nu_i \\quad \\quad \\text{(Equation 3)}$$\r\n\r\nWhere:\r\n- $AD_i$ represents average depth during interval $i$: $AD_i = \\frac{1}{2(N(T_i) - N(T_{i-1}) - 1)} \\sum_{n=N(T_{i-1})+1}^{N(T_i)} (q^B_n + q^A_n)$\r\n- $c$ and $\\lambda$ are constants to be estimated\r\n- $\\nu_i$ is a noise term\r\n\r\nThe stylized model predicts $\\lambda = 1$, which the empirical analysis largely confirms.\r\n\r\n## Empirical Methodology\r\n\r\n### Data Description\r\n\r\nThe analysis employs Trade and Quote (TAQ) data for 50 randomly selected S&P 500 constituent stocks during April 2010. This dataset provides comprehensive coverage of all quote updates and trades, capturing the full spectrum of order book activity. Key data characteristics include:\r\n\r\n- **Quote-to-trade ratio**: Approximately 40:1, highlighting the importance of non-trade events\r\n- **Time frequency**: 10-second intervals for baseline analysis, with robustness checks from 10 quote updates to 10 minutes\r\n- **Market coverage**: National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) aggregated across exchanges\r\n\r\nThe choice of 10-second intervals balances several considerations:\r\n1. **Noise reduction**: Longer intervals reduce the impact of microstructure noise and bid-ask bounce\r\n2. **Statistical power**: Sufficient observations within each half-hour estimation window\r\n3. **Economic relevance**: Time scale relevant for tactical trading decisions\r\n\r\n### Estimation Approach\r\n\r\nThe empirical strategy involves two-stage estimation:\r\n\r\n**Stage 1: Price Impact Estimation**\r\nFor each stock and each half-hour period $i$, estimate:\r\n$$\\Delta P_k = \\hat{\\alpha}_i + \\hat{\\beta}_i OFI_k + \\hat{\\varepsilon}_k \\quad \\quad \\text{(Equation 4)}$$\r\n\r\nThis yields time-varying estimates of the price impact coefficient $\\hat{\\beta}_i$.\r\n\r\n**Stage 2: Depth Relationship**\r\nRelate the price impact coefficients to market depth through:\r\n$$\\log \\hat{\\beta}_i = \\hat{\\alpha}_{L,i} - \\hat{\\lambda} \\log AD_i + \\hat{\\varepsilon}_{L,i} \\quad \\quad \\text{(Equation 5)}$$\r\n\r\n$$\\hat{\\beta}_i = \\hat{\\alpha}_{M,i} + \\frac{\\hat{c}}{AD_i^{\\hat{\\lambda}}} + \\hat{\\varepsilon}_{M,i} \\quad \\quad \\text{(Equation 6)}$$\r\n\r\nThe first equation estimates the exponent $\\hat{\\lambda}$, while the second estimates the constant $\\hat{c}$ conditional on $\\hat{\\lambda}$.\r\n\r\n## Empirical Results\r\n\r\n### Linear Price Impact Model Performance\r\n\r\nThe linear OFI model demonstrates remarkable explanatory power across all 50 stocks:\r\n\r\n- **Average R² = 65%**: The model explains nearly two-thirds of short-term price variation\r\n- **Coefficient significance**: The price impact coefficient $\\hat{\\beta}$ is statistically significant in 97% of half-hour subsamples\r\n- **Intercept insignificance**: The intercept term is statistically insignificant in most cases, supporting the linear specification without constant bias\r\n\r\nThese results are particularly striking given the 10-second frequency of the analysis. Traditional asset pricing models struggle to explain such a high proportion of high-frequency price variation.\r\n\r\n### Robustness Tests\r\n\r\n**Nonlinearity Tests**: Adding quadratic terms $\\hat{\\gamma}_{Q,i} OFI_k |OFI_k|$ to the regression increases R² only marginally (from 65% to 68%), with the quadratic coefficient statistically insignificant in most samples. This supports the linear specification.\r\n\r\n**Residual Analysis**: The distribution of residual excess kurtosis shows relatively low values, indicating that the model captures most price movements rather than missing extreme events that would appear as outliers.\r\n\r\n**Time Scale Robustness**: Results remain qualitatively similar across different time scales from 10 quote updates to 10 minutes, with R² generally increasing with longer aggregation intervals.\r\n\r\n### Depth-Impact Relationship\r\n\r\nThe relationship between price impact coefficients and market depth strongly supports the theoretical predictions:\r\n\r\n- **Exponent estimates**: $\\hat{\\lambda}$ averages close to 1 across stocks, with the hypothesis $\\{\\lambda = 1\\}$ failing to be rejected for 35 out of 50 stocks\r\n- **Fit quality**: The depth-impact regressions achieve high R² values (average 74%), demonstrating that observable market depth explains most variation in price impact\r\n- **Economic magnitude**: A doubling of market depth approximately halves the price impact coefficient\r\n\r\nThe three stocks with poor fits (APOL, AZO, CME) are characterized by wide spreads and low depth, suggesting that for these securities, factors beyond observable depth—such as hidden orders or deeper book levels—may dominate price impact dynamics.\r\n\r\n## Intraday Seasonality Patterns\r\n\r\n### Price Impact Seasonality\r\n\r\nThe relationship between price impact and market depth provides a natural explanation for well-documented intraday patterns in market volatility and transaction costs:\r\n\r\n**Market Open Effects**:\r\n- Market depth is approximately 50% of its average level at the open\r\n- Price impact coefficient is correspondingly twice its average level\r\n- The effect creates a five-fold difference between open and close impact levels\r\n\r\n**Volatility Decomposition**: The variance relationship provides insight into intraday volatility patterns:\r\n$$\\text{var}[\\Delta P_k]_i = \\beta_i^2 \\cdot \\text{var}[OFI_k]_i + \\text{var}[\\varepsilon_k]_i \\quad \\quad \\text{(Equation 7)}$$\r\n\r\nThis decomposition reveals that:\r\n- Price volatility peaks at market open due to high price impact (low depth)\r\n- Order flow imbalance volatility peaks at market close due to high activity\r\n- The interaction creates the familiar U-shaped intraday volatility pattern\r\n\r\n### Information Asymmetry Interpretation\r\n\r\nThe authors provide an alternative interpretation of information asymmetry theories. Rather than assuming unobservable information asymmetry parameters, they suggest:\r\n\r\n1. **Depth as information proxy**: Limit order traders may reduce posted quantities when they perceive higher information asymmetry, making depth an observable proxy for information conditions\r\n2. **Endogenous impact**: Higher information asymmetry leads to lower depth, which mechanically increases price impact\r\n3. **Harder information realization**: Higher price impact makes it more costly to profit from information advantages, creating a natural market defense mechanism\r\n\r\n## Comparison with Trade-Based Measures\r\n\r\n### Order Flow Imbalance vs. Trade Imbalance\r\n\r\nTraditional price impact studies focus on trade imbalance:\r\n$$TI_k = \\sum_{n=N(t_{k-1})+1}^{N(t_k)} b_n - \\sum_{n=N(t_{k-1})+1}^{N(t_k)} s_n$$\r\n\r\nWhere $b_n$ and $s_n$ represent buy and sell trade sizes.\r\n\r\n**Comparative Regression Analysis**:\r\n$$\\Delta P_k = \\hat{\\alpha}_i + \\hat{\\beta}_i OFI_k + \\hat{\\varepsilon}_k \\quad \\quad \\text{(8a)}$$\r\n$$\\Delta P_k = \\hat{\\alpha}_{T,i} + \\hat{\\beta}_{T,i} TI_k + \\hat{\\varepsilon}_{T,k} \\quad \\quad \\text{(8b)}$$\r\n$$\\Delta P_k = \\hat{\\alpha}_{D,i} + \\hat{\\theta}_{O,i} OFI_k + \\hat{\\theta}_{T,i} TI_k + \\hat{\\varepsilon}_{D,k} \\quad \\quad \\text{(8c)}$$\r\n\r\n**Key Findings**:\r\n- **OFI dominance**: OFI achieves R² = 65% vs. trade imbalance R² = 32%\r\n- **Redundancy of trades**: In the combined regression (8c), trade imbalance coefficients become statistically insignificant in 69% of samples\r\n- **Information content**: Trade effects are largely captured within the broader OFI measure\r\n\r\n### Implications for Trade Impact Models\r\n\r\nThese results challenge the conventional wisdom that trading volume is the primary driver of price impact. Instead, they suggest that trades matter only insofar as they contribute to overall supply-demand imbalance, with limit orders and cancellations playing equally important roles.\r\n\r\n## The Volume-Price Relationship Revisited\r\n\r\n### Theoretical Framework for Volume Effects\r\n\r\nThe relationship between trading volume and price changes has been extensively documented but poorly understood theoretically. The authors provide a scaling argument that explains apparent volume-price relationships as statistical artifacts.\r\n\r\n**Proposition 1**: Under assumptions of:\r\n1. Events accumulating at average rate $\\Lambda$: $N(T)/T \\to \\Lambda$\r\n2. Event contributions $\\{e_i\\}$ being i.i.d. with finite variance $\\sigma^2$\r\n3. Trade sizes $\\{w_i\\}$ being i.i.d. with mean $\\mu\\pi$ (where $\\pi$ is the trade probability)\r\n\r\nThe scaling relationship emerges:\r\n$$\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mu\\pi}}{\\sigma} \\frac{OFI(T)}{\\sqrt{VOL(T)}} \\Rightarrow \\xi \\sim N(0,1) \\quad \\quad \\text{(Equation 9)}$$\r\n\r\nThis implies:\r\n$$OFI(T) = \\xi \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\mu\\pi}} \\sqrt{VOL(T)} \\quad \\quad \\text{(Equation 13)}$$\r\n\r\nSubstituting into the linear price impact model:\r\n$$\\Delta P_k = \\theta_k \\sqrt{VOL_k} + \\varepsilon_k \\quad \\quad \\text{(Equation 14)}$$\r\n\r\nWhere $\\theta_k = \\beta_i \\xi_k \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\mu\\pi}}$ is random with $\\theta_k \\sim N(0, \\beta_i^2 \\sigma^2/(\\mu\\pi))$.\r\n\r\n### Empirical Volume Analysis\r\n\r\n**Power Law Estimation**: For each stock and time period, estimate:\r\n$$\\log |\\Delta P_k| = \\log \\hat{\\bar{\\theta}}_i + \\hat{H}_i \\log VOL_k + \\log \\hat{\\xi}_k \\quad \\quad \\text{(Equation 16)}$$\r\n\r\n**Key Findings**:\r\n- **Exponent variability**: $\\hat{H}$ varies considerably across stocks and time, averaging 0.18 but ranging widely\r\n- **Most exponents below 0.5**: Contradicts the commonly assumed square-root relationship\r\n- **High noise**: Volume-based models are inherently noisier due to the random coefficient structure\r\n\r\n**Comparative Analysis**:\r\n$$|\\Delta P_k| = \\hat{\\alpha}_{O,i} + \\hat{\\beta}_{O,i} |OFI_k| + \\hat{\\varepsilon}_{O,k} \\quad \\quad \\text{(17a)}$$\r\n$$|\\Delta P_k| = \\hat{\\alpha}_{V,i} + \\hat{\\beta}_{V,i} VOL_k^{\\hat{H}_i} +

\\quad \\quad \\text{(17c)}$$\r\n\r\n**Results**:\r\n- **OFI superiority**: |OFI| explains price magnitude better than volume (R² = 58% vs. 23%)\r\n- **Volume redundancy**: Volume effects become statistically insignificant when OFI is included\r\n- **Spurious correlation**: Volume-price relationships appear to be statistical artifacts of the correlation between volume and order flow imbalance\r\n\r\n## Practical Implications\r\n\r\n### For Trading Strategy\r\n\r\nThe findings have significant implications for optimal order execution:\r\n\r\n1. **Order scheduling**: Rather than focusing solely on volume patterns (Volume Weighted Average Price strategies), execution algorithms should monitor order flow imbalance to predict short-term price impact\r\n\r\n2. **Market timing**: Periods of high market depth offer lower price impact, suggesting optimal timing for large orders\r\n\r\n3. **Order type selection**: The equivalent treatment of market orders, limit orders, and cancellations in the OFI framework suggests more sophisticated approaches to order management\r\n\r\n### For Market Making\r\n\r\nMarket makers can benefit from understanding that:\r\n\r\n1. **Depth provision**: Providing depth during low-liquidity periods (high $\\beta$ regimes) offers higher compensation for inventory risk\r\n\r\n2. **Quote management**: The linear relationship suggests that incremental depth provision has consistent marginal impact on price stability\r\n\r\n3. **Risk management**: Order flow imbalance provides a more comprehensive risk signal than trade-based measures alone\r\n\r\n### For Regulatory Policy\r\n\r\nThe results inform market structure debates:\r\n\r\n1. **Market fragmentation**: The focus on NBBO aggregation suggests that fragmentation effects on price discovery may be limited as long as top-of-book liquidity is efficiently aggregated\r\n\r\n2. **High-frequency trading**: The importance of non-trade events suggests that regulations focusing solely on trading activity may miss important aspects of price formation\r\n\r\n3. **Market quality metrics**: Traditional measures of market quality might be enhanced by incorporating order flow imbalance dynamics\r\n\r\n## Limitations and Extensions\r\n\r\n### Model Limitations\r\n\r\nSeveral aspects of the analysis merit careful consideration:\r\n\r\n1. **Time aggregation**: The 10-second frequency may mask important microstructure dynamics occurring at higher frequencies\r\n\r\n2. **Level I data**: The analysis relies on top-of-book data only, potentially missing important information from deeper order book levels\r\n\r\n3. **Linear specification**: While empirically successful, the linear model may not capture nonlinear effects during extreme market conditions\r\n\r\n4. **Cross-sectional differences**: The model parameters vary significantly across stocks, suggesting that market-specific factors may be important\r\n\r\n### Potential Extensions\r\n\r\nFuture research could address:\r\n\r\n1. **Multi-level analysis**: Incorporating deeper order book levels to understand the role of total market depth versus top-of-book depth\r\n\r\n2. **Cross-asset analysis**: Extending the framework to other asset classes (bonds, currencies, commodities) to test generalizability\r\n\r\n3. **High-frequency dynamics**: Analyzing the model at tick-by-tick frequency to understand the immediate impact of individual orders\r\n\r\n4. **Market stress periods**: Examining whether the linear relationship holds during periods of extreme market stress\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThis research fundamentally reshapes our understanding of price formation in electronic markets. By introducing order flow imbalance as a comprehensive measure of supply-demand dynamics, Cont, Kukanov, and Stoikov demonstrate that price impact can be understood through a remarkably simple linear framework.\r\n\r\nThe key insights include:\r\n\r\n1. **Unified framework**: All order book events—market orders, limit orders, and cancellations—contribute equally to price impact through their effect on supply-demand balance\r\n\r\n2. **Linear relationship**: Despite the complexity of modern markets, the relationship between order flow imbalance and price changes is fundamentally linear\r\n\r\n3. **Depth dependence**: Price impact is inversely related to observable market depth, providing a transparent and actionable link between market structure and trading costs\r\n\r\n4. **Volume demystified**: The famous volume-price relationship appears to be a statistical artifact rather than a fundamental driver of price changes\r\n\r\n5. **Seasonality explanation**: Traditional intraday patterns in volatility and trading costs can be explained through the interaction of order flow and depth dynamics\r\n\r\nThese findings have profound implications for trading strategy, market making, and regulatory policy. They suggest that market participants should focus on order flow dynamics rather than trading volume, that market makers should consider depth provision as a key strategic variable, and that regulators should consider the full spectrum of order book activity in their market oversight.\r\n\r\nThe research also opens new avenues for understanding market efficiency, liquidity provision, and price discovery in modern electronic markets. As markets continue to evolve with technological advancement and regulatory change, the framework provided here offers a robust foundation for analyzing these developments.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity and empirical success of the linear order flow imbalance model represents a significant advance in market microstructure theory, providing both practical insights for market participants and theoretical foundation for future research.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

A ring is a set equipped with two binary operations that generalize the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication.\r\n\r\n## Definition of a Ring\r\n\r\nA **ring** is an algebraic structure $(R, +, \\cdot)$ consisting of a set $R$ together with two binary operations $+$ (addition) and $\\cdot$ (multiplication) such that:\r\n\r\n### Ring Axioms\r\n\r\n1. **$(R, +)$ is an abelian group:**\r\n   - **Closure**: $\\forall a, b \\in R: a + b \\in R$\r\n   - **Associativity**: $\\forall a, b, c \\in R: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$\r\n   - **Identity**: $\\exists 0 \\in R$ such that $\\forall a \\in R: a + 0 = 0 + a = a$\r\n   - **Inverse**: $\\forall a \\in R, \\exists (-a) \\in R$ such that $a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0$\r\n   - **Commutativity**: $\\forall a, b \\in R: a + b = b + a$\r\n\r\n2. **$(R, \\cdot)$ is a monoid:**\r\n   - **Closure**: $\\forall a, b \\in R: a \\cdot b \\in R$\r\n   - **Associativity**: $\\forall a, b, c \\in R: (a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$\r\n\r\n3. **Distributive laws:**\r\n   - **Left distributivity**: $\\forall a, b, c \\in R: a \\cdot (b + c) = (a \\cdot b) + (a \\cdot c)$\r\n   - **Right distributivity**: $\\forall a, b, c \\in R: (b + c) \\cdot a = (b \\cdot a) + (c \\cdot a)$\r\n\r\n## Types of Rings\r\n\r\n### Commutative Rings\r\nA ring $R$ is **commutative** if multiplication is commutative:\r\n$$\\forall a, b \\in R: a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a$$\r\n\r\n### Rings with Unity\r\nA ring $R$ has **unity** (or multiplicative identity) if there exists an element $1 \\in R$ such that:\r\n$$\\forall a \\in R: a \\cdot 1 = 1 \\cdot a = a$$\r\n\r\n### Integral Domains\r\nAn **integral domain** is a commutative ring with unity and no zero divisors. That is, if $a \\cdot b = 0$, then either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$.\r\n\r\n### Fields\r\nA **field** is a commutative ring with unity in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.\r\n\r\n## Examples of Rings\r\n\r\n### 1.

Polynomial Rings $R[x]$\r\nGiven a ring $R$, the set of polynomials with coefficients in $R$ forms a ring under polynomial addition and multiplication:\r\n$$f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_1 x + a_0$$\r\n\r\n### 3. Matrix Rings $M_n(R)$\r\nThe set of $n \\times n$ matrices with entries from a ring $R$ forms a ring under matrix addition and multiplication.\r\n\r\n### 4. Modular Arithmetic $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$\r\nThe integers modulo $n$ form a ring:\r\n$$\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} = \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$$\r\n\r\n## Important Concepts\r\n\r\n### Ideals\r\nAn **ideal** $I$ of a ring $R$ is a subset that is:\r\n- Closed under addition: $a, b \\in I \\Rightarrow a + b \\in I$\r\n- Closed under additive inverses: $a \\in I \\Rightarrow -a \\in I$\r\n- Absorbs multiplication: $a \\in I, r \\in R \\Rightarrow ra \\in I$ and $ar \\in I$\r\n\r\n### Prime Ideals\r\nAn ideal $P$ is **prime** if $P \\neq R$ and whenever $ab \\in P$, either $a \\in P$ or $b \\in P$.\r\n\r\n### Maximal Ideals\r\nAn ideal $M$ is **maximal** if $M \\neq R$ and there is no ideal $I$ such that $M \\subset I \\subset R$.\r\n\r\n## Ring Homomorphisms\r\n\r\nA **ring homomorphism** $\\phi: R \\to S$ is a function that preserves both ring operations:\r\n- $\\phi(a + b) = \\phi(a) + \\phi(b)$\r\n- $\\phi(a \\cdot b) = \\phi(a) \\cdot \\phi(b)$\r\n\r\n### Kernel and Image\r\nFor a ring homomorphism $\\phi: R \\to S$:\r\n- **Kernel**: $\\ker(\\phi) = \\{r \\in R : \\phi(r) = 0_S\\}$\r\n- **Image**: $\\text{Im}(\\phi) = \\{\\phi(r) : r \\in R\\}$\r\n\r\n## Fundamental Theorems\r\n\r\n### First Isomorphism Theorem\r\nIf $\\phi: R \\to S$ is a ring homomorphism, then:\r\n$$R/\\ker(\\phi) \\cong \\text{Im}(\\phi)$$\r\n\r\n### Chinese Remainder Theorem\r\nIf $I_1, I_2, \\ldots, I_n$ are pairwise coprime ideals in a ring $R$, then:\r\n$$R/(I_1 \\cap I_2 \\cap \\cdots \\cap I_n) \\cong R/I_1 \\times R/I_2 \\times \\cdots \\times R/I_n$$\r\n\r\n## Applications\r\n\r\n### Algebraic Number Theory\r\nRing theory provides the foundation for studying algebraic integers and number fields.\r\n\r\n### Algebraic Geometry\r\nThe correspondence between geometric objects and algebraic structures relies heavily on ring theory.\r\n\r\n### Coding Theory\r\nError-correcting codes often use finite fields and polynomial rings.\r\n\r\n## Exercises\r\n\r\n1. **Prove** that in any ring, $0 \\cdot a = a \\cdot 0 = 0$ for all $a \\in R$.\r\n\r\n2. **Show** that $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ is a field if and only if $p$ is prime.\r\n\r\n3. **Determine** all ideals of $\\mathbb{Z}$.\r\n\r\n4. **Prove** that every maximal ideal is prime.\r\n\r\n## Further Reading\r\n\r\n- Hungerford, T.

The IRS model is found to be positive and strongly correlated with the RS model, providing a straightforward, computationally less-intensive method suitable for various asset pricing studies.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nThe market liquidity plays an authoritative role in financial transaction execution. Liquidity has immediate impact on trading, and liquidity risk has gained significant attention in asset pricing, corporate financing, and portfolio risk management. The bid-ask spread is a significant indicator of market liquidity and its associated cost.\r\n\r\nThe paper proposes a new estimation called the Informed Realized Spread (IRS), a modified version of the Realized Spread (RS) that exclusively illustrates asymmetric information effects on spread size.\r\n\r\n## Realized Spread (RS) Model\r\nThe analytical expression of the RS estimator is given by:\r\n\r\n$$RS_t = 2|\\eta_{t+1} - C_t| \\cdot \\frac{high_t + low_t}{2}$$\r\n\r\nwhere:\r\n- $high_t$ is the highest price of day $t$\r\n- $low_t$ refers to the lowest price of day $t$\r\n- $C_t$ indicates the closing price of day $t$\r\n- $\\eta_{t+1}$ is a mean value of the following trading-day high and low prices:\r\n\r\n$$\\eta_{t+1} = \\frac{high_{t+1} + low_{t+1}}{2}$$\r\n\r\n## Informed Realized Spread (IRS) Model\r\nThe IRS model assumes that asymmetric information about the fundamental value drives trading, following Glosten and Milgrom (1985). The informed trader gains from trading, and the model assumes the presence of informed traders with different expectations.\r\n\r\nThe buyer-initiated trade is expected to be executed if:\r\n\r\n$$E[buy_{t+1}] = E[v_{ask}] = E[ask_{t+1}]$$\r\n\r\nThe seller-initiated trade is assumed to be executed if:\r\n\r\n$$E[sell_{t+1}] = E[v_{bid}] = E[bid_{t+1}]$$\r\n\r\nAssuming the presence of an informed optimistic buyer:\r\n\r\n$$E[ask_{t+1}] = high_{t+1} \\cdot \\gamma + \\left(\\frac{high_{t+1} + low_{t+1}}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\gamma$$\r\n\r\nAssuming the presence of an informed pessimistic seller:\r\n\r\n$$E[bid_{t+1}] = low_{t+1} \\cdot \\gamma + \\left(\\frac{high_{t+1} + low_{t+1}}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\gamma$$\r\n\r\nThe expected mean value conditional on the following trading session:\r\n\r\n$$E[\\eta_{t+1}] = \\frac{E[ask_{t+1}] + E[bid_{t+1}]}{2}$$\r\n\r\nInserting the expected mean value into the RS formula yields the IRS model:\r\n\r\n$$IRS_t = 2|E[\\eta_{t+1}] - C_t| \\cdot \\frac{High_t + Low_t}{2}$$\r\n\r\n## Theoretical Framework\r\nThe market makers are compensated against price variation risk, return uncertainty, and market environment. The RS model elucidates the immediacy cost that liquidity providers ask against providing liquidity.\r\n\r\nThe IRS model structures asymmetric information in the RS method, assuming informed traders drive trading. Optimistic buyers accept inventory at higher ask prices, while pessimistic sellers redeem positions at lower bid prices.\r\n\r\n## Data and Methods\r\nThe analysis uses Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) data from January 1, 2001 to April 30, 2021, with daily observations of high, low, and closing prices.\r\n\r\n### Spread Proxies\r\n**Quoted Spread (QS):**\r\n\r\n$$QS_t = \\frac{high_t - low_t}{\\eta_t}$$\r\n\r\nwhere $\\eta_t$ is the mean value of high and low prices on day $t$.\r\n\r\n**Effective Spread (ES):**\r\n\r\n$$ES_t = 2|C_t - \\eta_t| \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\eta_t}$$\r\n\r\n**Realized Spread (RS):** As defined above.\r\n\r\n**Informed Realized Spread (IRS):** As defined above.\r\n\r\n## Results\r\n### Descriptive Statistics\r\nThe table shows descriptive statistics for the spread proxies:\r\n\r\n| Variable | N    | Min       | Median   | Mean     | Max       | SD       | Skewness |\r\n|----------|------|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|----------|----------|\r\n| RS      | 5050 | 2.30E-16 | 0.01109 | 0.01531 | 0.43841  | 0.01699 | 5.64298 |\r\n| IRS     | 5050 | 2.30E-16 | 0.01109 | 0.01531 | 0.43841  | 0.01699 | 5.64298 |\r\n| QS      | 5050 | 0.001197 | 0.01485 | 0.01755 | 0.18281  | 0.01115 | 3.57961 |\r\n| ES      | 5050 | 2.29E-16 | 0.00746 | 0.00974 | 0.16897  | 0.00975 | 4.01687 |\r\n\r\n### Correlation Analysis\r\nThe correlation coefficients between variables:\r\n\r\n| Variables | RS   | IRS  | QS   | ES   |\r\n|-----------|------|------|------|------|\r\n| RS       | 1    | 1    | 0.34 | 0.23 |\r\n| IRS      | 1    | 1    | 0.34 | 0.23 |\r\n| QS       | 0.34 | 0.34 | 1    | 0.76 |\r\n| ES       | 0.23 | 0.23 | 0.76 | 1    |\r\n\r\nThe IRS measure shows strong correlation with RS (correlation = 1), moderate correlation with QS (0.34), and low correlation with ES (0.23).\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\nThe IRS model provides a simple, computationally efficient method to estimate informed trading effects on bid-ask spreads. Despite theoretical differences from other spread proxies, IRS shows strong correlation with RS and provides valuable insights for asset pricing studies.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- Saleemi, J. (2022).

The deep reinforcement learning controller is compared to multiple market making benchmarks, showing superior performance in risk-reward metrics, even under significant transaction costs.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nOptimal market making is the problem of placing bid and ask orders simultaneously on both sides of the limit order book (LOB) to maximize trader terminal wealth while minimizing inventory risk. The classical Avellaneda-Stoikov (AS) framework reduces the problem to a system of ODEs and derives closed-form approximations.\r\n\r\nThis work employs deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve the market making problem under a weakly consistent, multivariate Hawkes process-based LOB model. The Hawkes process captures self- and cross-excitation effects between order arrivals, providing realistic microstructural dynamics.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n### Hawkes Processes\r\nA p-dimensional linear Hawkes process N(t) = (N_k(t))_{k=1}^p has intensity:\r\n\r\n$$\\lambda_k(t) = \\mu_k + \\sum_{l=1}^p \\int_{-\\infty}^t f_{k,l}(t-s) dN_l(s)$$\r\n\r\nFor exponential kernels:\r\n\r\n$$\\lambda_k(t) = \\mu_k + \\sum_{l=1}^p \\int_{-\\infty}^t \\alpha_{k,l} e^{-\\beta_{k,l}(t-s)} dN_l(s)$$\r\n\r\n### Limit Order Book Events\r\nThe model considers 8 event types representing main LOB events:\r\n- Aggressive market orders: M_a_b (buy), M_a_s (sell)\r\n- Non-aggressive market orders: M_n_b (buy), M_n_s (sell)\r\n- Aggressive limit orders: L_a_b (buy), L_a_s (sell)\r\n- Aggressive cancellations: C_a_b (buy), C_a_s (sell)\r\n\r\n### Market Dynamics\r\nThe mid-price P_t evolves as:\r\n\r\n$$P_t = P_0 + \\frac{\\delta}{2} \\left( \\sum_{e \\in E_{inc}} J_e - \\sum_{e \\in E_{dec}} J_e \\right)$$\r\n\r\nwhere:\r\n- E_inc = {M_a_b, L_a_b, C_a_s}\r\n- E_dec = {M_a_s, L_a_s, C_a_b}\r\n- J_e is the jump size (in ticks)\r\n- δ is the tick size\r\n\r\n### Inventory Process\r\nThe market maker's inventory I_t satisfies:\r\n\r\n$$dI_t = dN_b^t - dN_a^t + dN_{mb}^t - dN_{ms}^t$$\r\n\r\nwhere N_b^t, N_a^t are executed limit orders, N_mb^t, N_ms^t are market orders.\r\n\r\n### Cash Process\r\nThe cash process X_t is:\r\n\r\n$$dX_t = Q_a^t dN_a^t - Q_b^t dN_b^t - (P_a^t + \\epsilon_t) dN_{mb}^t + (P_b^t - \\epsilon_t) dN_{ms}^t$$\r\n\r\nwhere Q_a^t, Q_b^t are quote prices, P_a^t, P_b^t are best prices, ε_t are fees.\r\n\r\n## Model Setup\r\n### State Space\r\nThe state space S_t consists of:\r\n- Inventory I_t ∈ {-c, ..., c}\r\n- Bid-ask spread Δ_t (in ticks)\r\n- Trend variable α_t = λ_{M_a_b}(t) + λ_{M_n_b}(t) - λ_{M_a_s}(t) - λ_{M_n_s}(t)\r\n\r\nNormalized using min-max scaling.\r\n\r\n### Action Space\r\nActions A_t are pairs of offsets from best bid/ask prices:\r\n- A_t = (Q_a^t - P_a^t, P_b^t - Q_b^t)\r\n- Discrete action space with size varying from 1 to 4*15\r\n- Actions rounded to tick size\r\n- Invalid actions (negative spread) are ignored\r\n\r\n### Reward Function\r\nThe reward R_{t+Δt} is the change in net worth minus inventory penalty:\r\n\r\n$$R_{t+Δt} = \\Delta W_{t+Δt} - \\phi \\int_t^{t+Δt} |I_s| ds$$\r\n\r\nwhere W_t = I_t P_t + X_t is total wealth, φ ≥ 0 is penalty parameter.\r\n\r\n## Deep Reinforcement Learning\r\n### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\r\nPPO is an on-policy, actor-critic algorithm using clipped surrogate objective:\r\n\r\n$$L^{CLIP}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_t \\left[ \\min \\left( r_t(\\theta) \\hat{A}_t, \\clip(r_t(\\theta), 1-\\epsilon, 1+\\epsilon) \\hat{A}_t \\right) \\right]$$\r\n\r\nwhere r_t(θ) = π_θ(a_t|s_t) / π_θ_old(a_t|s_t), ε is clipping parameter.\r\n\r\n### Network Architecture\r\n- 2-layer MLP with 64 neurons per layer\r\n- ReLU activation\r\n- Separate actor and critic networks\r\n- Adam optimizer\r\n\r\n### Training Details\r\n- Time step Δt = 1\r\n- Terminal time T = 100\r\n- Tick size δ = 0.01\r\n- Inventory penalty φ = 0.01\r\n- Inventory constraint c = 3\r\n- Transaction fees: 0% for limit orders, 0.2% for market orders\r\n\r\n## Experiments\r\n### Baselines\r\n- **Linear (LIN)**: Linear strategy in inventory with constraints\r\n- **Symmetric (SYM)**: Places orders at best bid/ask\r\n- **Avellaneda-Stoikov (AS)**: Classical approximation (adapted)\r\n\r\n### Evaluation Metrics\r\n- **Profit and Loss (PnL)**: Terminal wealth distribution\r\n- **Annualized Return (AR)**: (PnL / initial capital)^(252/T) - 1\r\n- **Maximum Drawdown (MDD)**: Max peak-to-trough decline\r\n- **Mean Absolute Position (MAP)**: Average |inventory|\r\n- **Sharpe Ratio**: AR / volatility of returns\r\n\r\n### Results\r\nTable shows performance comparison:\r\n\r\n| Metric | DRL | SYM | LIN |\r\n|--------|-----|-----|-----|\r\n| Mean AR | 13.76 | 9.87 | 8.21 |\r\n| Std AR | 8.50 | 8.24 | 5.79 |\r\n| Mean MDD | 17.17 | 17.17 | 16.51 |\r\n| Sharpe | 1.62 | 1.20 | 1.42 |\r\n| MAP | 0.42 | 1.47 | 0.55 |\r\n\r\nDRL shows superior performance across all metrics.\r\n\r\n### Sensitivity Analysis\r\n#### Transaction Costs\r\nFigure shows Sharpe ratio vs limit order fees:\r\n\r\n- DRL maintains performance up to 0.6% fees\r\n- LIN fails at 0.4% fees\r\n- SYM fails at 0.2% fees\r\n\r\n#### Trading Frequency\r\nMean transactions decrease with higher fees:\r\n- 0% fees: 24.54 trades\r\n- 0.2% fees: 15.0 trades\r\n- 0.4% fees: 11.28 trades\r\n- 0.6% fees: 7.85 trades\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\nThe proposed DRL approach using PPO provides superior market making performance compared to traditional benchmarks, even under high transaction costs. The Hawkes process-based LOB model ensures realistic microstructural dynamics, making the approach suitable for practical applications.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- Gašperov, B., & Kostanjčar, Z.

Poorly calibrated simulators can lead to misleading conclusions, potentially causing severe loss when employed by investment banks, hedge funds, and traders to study and evaluate trading strategies. In this paper, we propose a world model simulator that accurately emulates a limit order book market – it requires no agent calibration but rather learns the simulated market behavior directly from historical data. Traditional approaches fail short to learn and calibrate trader population, as historical labeled data with details on each individual trader strategy is not publicly available. Our approach proposes to learn a unique \"world\" agent from historical data. It is intended to emulate the overall trader population, without the need of making assumptions about individual market agent strategies. We implement our world agent simulator models as a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN), as well as a mixture of parametric distributions, and we compare our models against previous work. Qualitatively and quantitatively, we show that the proposed approaches consistently outperform previous work, providing more realism and responsiveness.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nFinancial markets are among the most complex systems in existence. Naturally described as multi-agent systems, they comprise thousands of interacting heterogeneous participants. Nowadays, both researchers and traders heavily rely on artificial market models, to support the design of algorithms, as well as testing novel trading strategies.\r\n\r\nArtificial market models can help to isolate and study the impact of new algorithms to the price and volume of the stocks [19]; they can explain the nature of some rare financial market phenomena, such as bubbles and crashes [22]; or they can just be used to study and test trading strategies, before approaching the real market [6].\r\n\r\nPrevious work mostly focuses on multi-agent modeling, which is a natural bottom-up approach to emulate financial markets [8]. In these models, a number of decision-makers (agents or traders) and institutions, interact through prescribed rules to build the market. Several multi-agent simulators have been developed, by traders and researchers [3,4,23]. However, modeling a realistic market through a multi-agent simulation is still a major challenge [8,18]. In fact, specifying how the agents should behave and interact in the simulation is not obvious. While some agents can be modeled following a common sense or historical analysis [9,24], in general market participants adopt unknown proprietary trading strategies. Moreover, public available historical data does not include attribution to the various market participants, which makes the calibration of the agents challenging.\r\n\r\nTo overcome this challenge, learning to simulate from the data as a world model was introduced in [6]. This approach assumed a unique agent trained as a conditional generative adversarial Network (CGAN) [17] from historical data, without the need of making assumptions about the individual market agent strategies.\r\n\r\nThe world agent was simplistic: it was only capable of placing limit orders which usually account for just 50% of all trading actions. Nevertheless, it was shown in [6] that this model could reproduce stylized facts as well as some form of market impact of trading - hence, this work provides a first attempt to a realistic and responsive world model.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we improve the design of the CGAN-based world model by extending it to support all main market actions (i.e., market order, add limit order, cancel order, and replace order), and we describe it alongside another world model constructed explicitly as a mixture of parametric distributions. Moreover, we improve the CGAN robustness and stability by unrolling the model during the training.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate that both approaches presented in this paper outperform previous work on world model construction by providing higher degree of simulation realism. We also emphasize and experimentally demonstrate that the GAN-based model applies to different heterogeneous stocks, as it does not make explicit assumptions about the data distributions.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n### Limit Order Book (LOB)\r\nFinancial markets offer a place for buyers and sellers to meet and trade on different assets. Modern electronic markets, such as NASDAQ, provide ad-hoc message protocols to facilitate trades and provides real-time information about the market order flow and state.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the ITCH [13] protocol provides access to anonymized market data with highest granularity, including all the orders in the market. The main four fundamental orders are: Market orders, Add limit orders, Cancel orders, and Replace orders. They respectively indicate the intention of trading a given amount of shares at any price; the intention of trading shares at a fixed limit price; a cancellation of a previous limit order; and a modification to a previous limit order (e.g., a change in the price or quantity).\r\n\r\nMost equity markets employ a continuous-time double auction mechanism to handle the stream of orders, and to execute a transaction whenever a buyer and seller agree on the price [2]. To store the supply and demand for each asset, the market exchange uses an electronic record called limit order book (LOB). The LOB keeps record of all outstanding limit orders into different levels, organized by price, and it continuously updates them according to incoming orders.\r\n\r\nFigure 2 shows a snapshot of a LOB with the available supply (red bars) and demand (green bars). The first bars (L1) represent the first level, the second bars (L2) the second level, and so on. Each bar keeps the outstanding orders into a queue structure. An add limit order to buy will update the existing demand, increasing the queue size (see Figure 2 light green); while a cancel order will decrease the queue size, and consequently reduce supply or demand.\r\n\r\n### Artificial Market properties\r\nRealism. Evaluating trading strategies against poorly calibrated market models can lead to poor and misleading conclusions, potentially causing severe loss when we employ these strategies on real markets. To assess the realism of artificial models, researchers commonly evaluate their ability to reproduce statistical properties of real markets called stylized facts [2,7,24].\r\n\r\nFor example, as asset daily returns usually have fat tail distribution and long-range dependence, we expected the same properties (or stylized facts) from artificial markets. In Section 5 we show that our approach outperforms existing work under a wide range of stylized facts. In particular, we consider auto-correlations, heavy tails distribution, and long range dependence to evaluate asset return properties. While we consider order volumes, time to first fill, depth and market spread distributions, to evaluate the volumes and order flow.\r\n\r\nResponsiveness. Another desirable property of artificial market models is the responsiveness to exogenous trading orders: the model should emulate the market reaction to new orders, providing a tool to investigate strategies' impact on the market. For example, the arrival of several buy (sell) market orders commonly causes the rise (fall) of the price. This phenomenon is called price impact, and it desirable that a responsive model exhibit this behavior.\r\n\r\nIn section 5 we evaluate the responsiveness of our model by simulating the arrival of a burst of buy/sell orders [1].\r\n\r\n## Related Work\r\nArtificial market models are increasingly adopted and developed to support researchers, practitioners, and traders [3,5,6,8,18,25,26].\r\n\r\nInteractive Agent-Based Simulators (IABS) are popular models that represent the market by means of a set of trading agents that interact through prescribed rules. These simulators usually describe the agent population and their interaction by a set of common sense hand-crafted rules, made to mimic real markets [24].\r\n\r\nIn [9] Farmer et al. show how zero intelligence (ZI) agents are able to replicate some market dynamics, (i.e., spread and price) by placing random orders. ZI agents have no knowledge of the market, however they can emulate some market reactions to exogenous events, and Palit et al. [21] show that they also reproduce some stylized facts of real markets, like the fat tails and long-range dependencies. Recently, S. Vyetrenko et al. [24] use ZI agents along heuristic belief learning (HBL) agents, which actually exploit order book information, to simulate and study spoofing attacks.\r\n\r\nHowever, the recent work of S. Vyetrenko et al. [24] discusses how the calibration of a realistic population of agents is a challenging task, as historical labeled data, with details about traders and their individual strategies, are not publicly available. The authors study different hand-crafted agent configurations, and they propose related stylized facts to evaluate the realism of simulation.\r\n\r\nOther work on market modeling leverages learning approaches, either by using adaptive agents, which learn from experience and evolve towards a more realistic behavior [14,16], or by directly generating synthetic LOB data [6, 15].\r\n\r\nThe work of J. Li et al. [15] shows a first attempt to generate realistic LOB data. However, they focus on synthetic data generation, not considering market simulation and properties like responsiveness.\r\n\r\nThe work of Coletta et al. [6] introduces the world model to learn how simulate a realistic market from data. This approach assumed a unique agent trained as a CGAN from historical data, without the need of individual market agent strategies or data. However, the model considers only add limit orders, which account for just 50% of all trading actions, resulting in a partial market representation. We extend this work to all the main trading actions, and we evaluate it against our proposal in Section 5.\r\n\r\n## The World Model\r\nThe world model provides a novel approach to market simulation: it considers a unique world agent trained on historical data to emulate the whole traders' population, without the need of individual market agent strategies. The world agent observes the market state and generates the next trading action emulating the real traders' behavior. Figure 1 shows the world agent representing the whole ensemble of trading agents.\r\n\r\nFormally, the world agent can be described as a conditional probability distribution F(x|y) that generates the next market action x given some information y about the market.\r\n\r\nThe action x represents a trading order to the exchange, which advances the simulation into a new market state. Thus, by iteratively generating new orders the simulation advances in time, exploiting the world agent to generate the market.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\nWe consider 4 possible actions representing the main trading orders, which are defined as follows:\r\n\r\n- Add Limit Order is a 3-tuple composed by <depth, side, quantity>\r\n- Market Order is a 2-tuple composed by <side, quantity>\r\n- Cancel Order is a 3-tuple composed by <cancel depth, side, queue position>\r\n- Replace Order is a 5-tuple composed by <cancel depth, side, queue position, new depth, new quantity>\r\n\r\nWe introduce p_i^a(t), v_i^a(t), p_i^b(t), v_i^b(t) as the price and volume size at i-th level of the LOB, at time t, for ask and bid respectively.\r\n\r\nThe depth d(t) of a limit order describes the order price p(t) with respect to the best-bid and best-ask as follows:\r\n\r\np(t) = {\r\n  p_1^b(t) - d(t), if side = BID\r\n  p_1^a(t) + d(t), else\r\n}\r\n\r\nWe consider depths rather than prices to improve model stability: depths are almost stationary, conversely to prices that change over time.\r\n\r\nThe side and quantity describe the amount of shares and the side of an order (i.e., bid or ask), respectively.\r\n\r\nCancel depth and queue position are used to cancel and replace orders, as they accurately describe cancellation and replacement dynamics of real markets [2]. In particular, the cancel depth identifies the order book level, while the queue position identifies the specific order at that level.\r\n\r\n### Market state\r\nModeling the market state plays the fundamental role of conditioning the generative model, to produce accurate and responsive actions. We introduce a set of features that best describe the current market s_t at time t, and the ongoing events.\r\n\r\nWe first define the volume imbalance I_i(t) as the demand and supply inequality within the first i levels:\r\n\r\nI_i(t) = (∑_{j=1}^i v_j^b(t)) / (∑_{j=1}^i v_j^b(t) + v_j^a(t))\r\n\r\nThe volume inequality is a strong predictor of the future price change [2], and provides a view of the current market state.\r\n\r\nAlong the imbalance, we also define the absolute volume V_i(t) within the first i levels:\r\n\r\nV_i(t) = ∑_{j=1}^i v_j^b(t) + v_j^a(t)\r\n\r\nThis feature helps the model balancing between cancel and limit orders, and generating accurate quantities and depths, to keep consistent volumes over the day.\r\n\r\nWe define the order-sign imbalance O_N(t) for a history window of N events as follows:\r\n\r\nO_N(t) = (1/N) ∑_{j=t-N}^t ε(j)\r\n\r\nwhere ε(j) is the sign of a market order at event-time j, if any. We consider ε(j) = 1 for a sell market order, and ε(j) = -1 for a buy market order. This feature provides knowledge about the price trend in the recent history, and about price impact phenomena.\r\n\r\nWe consider the market spread δ(t), defined as:\r\n\r\nδ(t) = p_1^a(t) - p_1^b(t)\r\n\r\nIt helps the model balancing between liquidity provider and liquidity taker behavior, and to shape order depths.\r\n\r\nFinally, we consider the price return r_N(t) for a history window of N events, defined as follows:\r\n\r\nr_N(t) = (m(t)/m(t-N)) - 1\r\n\r\nThe returns describe the current market trends.\r\n\r\n## Explicit model: mixture of parametric distributions\r\nWe now introduce a simple and understandable world agent model based on classic parametric distributions. We observe that the considered trading actions are composed of ordinal features with an unbounded range (e.g. quantity) but also relatively well-balanced categorical features (i.e., side and order type). Therefore, we consider a world agent expressed as a product of successive conditional distributions. We first condition the generation process with categorical features, which allows us to break down the order distributions into smaller conditional pieces, which are modeled with simple distributions. Figure 3 shows the proposed approach in which the order type and side break down the complexity of the generation process, and condition the ordinal features (e.g., depth and quantity). Notice that, we use the following abbreviations: LO, MO, REP, and CAN, to identify add limit orders, market orders, replace orders, and cancel orders, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe decomposition makes the world agent easier and more understandable: we can fit each distribution directly on the data, and independently from other distributions. We use classic and well-studied distributions, which have been carefully chosen after an accurate analysis of data, and according to existing literature [2,24].\r\n\r\nWe use closed-form maximum likelihood or moment matching estimators to fit the distributions' parameters. For example, P_LO|s_t is fitted as a fixed probability estimated using empirical proportions of actions in the historical data. At the second level of conditioning, P_SELL|LO, s_t is fitted using only historical data in which the trading actions are limit order placements. To easily decompose the problem, and make it tractable and understandable, we make the following assumptions: - for limit order placement and replacement, we assume that depth and quantity are independent; - for order replacement, we assume that new depth and new quantity are independent from the former ones.\r\n\r\nWe now introduce the distributions used for the categorical features. For the order type we use a multinomial distribution fitted on historical data, while the side consists of a binomial distribution conditioned on the order type and the volume imbalance I_5(t), using a logistic model per each type. The logistic models show high probability of generating a BID limit order when I_5(t) ≈ 0, which indicates that most of the volume is on the ASK side, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nOnce we identify the order type and side, we use the following distributions to capture each specific order feature:\r\n\r\n- We describe the depth of a limit or replace order by a mixture of a beta-binomial distribution and an empirical multinomial distribution. The first distribution models negative depths while the latter accounts for positive depths. The probability of having a negative depth is modeled with a logistic regression, dependent on the market spread δ(t) and volume imbalance I_5(t).\r\n\r\n- We represent the order quantity as a mixture of two negative-binomial distributions. We observe that most of the investors trade quantities that are multiples of 100 shares, therefore one distribution describes quantities that are multiples of 100, and the other distribution is used for quantities that are not multiples of 100.\r\n\r\n- We represent the cancel depth using a negative-binomial distribution, considering replace and cancel orders separately.\r\n\r\n- We model the cancel queue position using a beta-binomial distribution, considering replace and cancel orders separately.\r\n\r\nFinally, we model the inter-arrival time of orders by fitting a gamma distribution on historical data. The inter-arrival time is the time between two consecutive orders, and it determines when the world agent is triggered to generate another trading action.\r\n\r\nBoth our world models use this gamma distribution to model the inter-arrival times. In the experimental section, Figure 6 shows the time to fill for limit orders, which is strongly related to the order inter-arrival times. As both world models show a realistic time to fill, we can conclude that the gamma distribution generates inter-arrival times properly.\r\n\r\n## CGAN model\r\nWe now introduce a CGAN-based world agent implemented through a conditional Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) [12]. We consider a WGAN-GP as it provides a more stable training and allows to deal with discrete data: it minimizes the Wasserstein-1 distance between real and synthetic data distributions, which is continuous and differentiable almost everywhere. In a WGAN-GP the discriminator does not classify samples, but it rather outputs a real value evaluating their realism, thus we refer to it as a Critic.\r\n\r\nNote that in contrast with explicit model learning described in the previous section, the CGAN architecture does not take any parametric assumptions, and hence can be more easily extended to training on data that represents stocks with different dynamics.\r\n\r\n### Model input\r\nOur CGAN generator G(z|y) takes as input a vector of Gaussian random noise z ∼ N(0,1) and a vector y containing market information. We represent the market state at time t as an ordered vector s_t defined as follows:\r\n\r\ns_t = {I_1(t), I_5(t), O_128(t), O_256(t), V_1(t), V_5(t), δ(t), r_1(t), r_50(t)}\r\n\r\nTo capture the market evolution over time, we define y as the concatenation of the last T historical market states: y = {s_{t-T}, ..., s_t}.\r\n\r\n### Model Output\r\nThe generator outputs a synthetic trading action, which may have different attributes upon its type: a market order has a side and a quantity, while an add limit order requires also a specific depth.\r\n\r\nTo have an universal representation for all the orders, we consider an output vector ˆx including all the possible attributes:\r\n\r\nˆx = (depth, cancel depth, qty_x, qty_100x, qty type, order type, side)\r\n\r\nThe order type assumes values in {-1,0,1} and it discriminates between market orders, add limit orders and cancel orders. In our CGAN architecture the replace orders are represented and learned by a sequence of a cancel and an add limit order. The order quantity is represented by 3-attributes, namely qty_x, qty_100x and qty type, and it is defined as follows:\r\n\r\nquantity = {\r\n  qty_x, if qty type = 1\r\n  100 · qty_100x, else\r\n}\r\n\r\nAs described in the previous section, most of the investors trade multiples of 100 shares, thus we use qty type to discriminate their orders, and qty_100x to learn the hundreds digits of the quantity.\r\n\r\nThe side assumes values in {-1,1} and it distinguishes SELL and BUY orders. Finally, the depth and cancel depth assume discrete values in Z, and they represent the price of the order to add or modify, respectively. To reduce the action space, the queue position is predicted through a beta-binomial distribution considering its stable and regular distribution.\r\n\r\nNotice that, depending on the order type, only some attributes are meaningful and used: for an add limit order we consider both depth, side and quantity attributes, but for a cancel order we consider just the cancel depth and the side.\r\n\r\n### Model training and architecture\r\nFigure 4 shows the proposed CGAN architecture, which extends the previous model presented in [6]. In particular, our CGAN improves stability and responsiveness by unrolling the model during the training. In [6] the model is trained using only ground truth market states: at each training iteration the CGAN receives a real market state s_t to generate the next order x_{t+1}. At test time, when the model is employed, and unrolled in a closed-loop simulation, the CGAN may encounter unseen states induced by a previous sequence of sub-optimal actions. Unseen states can lead to poor and misleading simulation (e.g., exponential market growth). To mitigate unseen and unrealistic market states, we feed the generated orders into a simulator that advances the market state, and we let the critic evaluates both generated orders and states during the training. Most important, we unroll the model during training: we generate k steps ahead, feeding the model with the previous generated market states. This approach enforces the model to deal with synthetic market states, improving stability and realism: actions that led to unrealistic states will be penalized, while we also minimize unseen states.\r\n\r\n## Experiments\r\nIn this section we evaluate our world model by comparing the two proposed approaches in terms of realism and responsiveness. We train our models using NASDAQ TotalView data [20] sent via ITCH protocol [13] replayed at a simulated exchange at the trading action level. We consider four small-tick stocks, i.e., AVXL, AINV, CNR and AMZN, we use 3 to 4 days of data to train the models, and 9 days for testing. The results are averaged for each stock, over the 9 days period. We implement our models extending ABIDES simulator [3], and we feed real data market from 09:30 to 10:00 to initialize the simulated market, and condition the models.\r\n\r\nFor simplicity, we refer to the model implemented through a mixture of parametric distributions as the explicit model (see Section 4.1), while we refer to the CGAN-based model as the CGAN model (see Section 4.2).\r\n\r\n### Previous work comparison\r\nWe first compare our models against the previous work of Coletta et al. [6]. Figure 5 right column charts show the order types in the real and synthetic markets. While both our models closely resemble the market structure, the previous work of Coletta et al. [6] (green chart) only represents limit orders, accounting for just 50% of all orders and lacking of realism.\r\n\r\nThe left column charts show the demand and supply (i.e., outstanding limit orders) at the first level of the order book, for real and simulated markets. The orange dots represent the average ASK volumes (supply), while the blue dots represent the average BID volumes (demand). The filled area represents the values between the 5th and 95th percentile. The charts clearly show unrealistic volumes that exponential increase for the work in [6] (second chart), mainly caused by the absence of cancel and market orders. Instead, our CGAN model faithfully reproduces real market volumes (fourth chart), while the explicit model overestimates the volumes (third chart) but it keeps reasonable average values (dots) and does not show exponential growth.\r\n\r\n### Volumes and order flow stylized facts\r\nWe now evaluate the ability of the explicit and CGAN model to reproduce a set of market stylized facts for a given stock, namely AVXL. We first investigate the time to first fill, defined as the time elapsed between the placing of a limit order and its actual execution. This stylized fact describes how closely the synthetic market captures the real market dynamics and liquidity. Liquid markets usually have low time to first fill, compared to less liquid ones.\r\n\r\nFigure 6 shows that both proposed models generate a realistic time to first fill, with a median time less than 50 seconds (yellow vertical line). The CGAN model produces a slightly more accurate market compared to the explicit model: the average (red line) and 75th percentile (black line) values are closer to the real ones.\r\n\r\nThen, we analyse the incoming volume in real and simulated markets. Figure 7 shows the volumes of add limit orders, aggregated in a minute time window: the dots represent the average incoming volumes per minute, while the filled area represents the 5th and 95th percentile values. This stylized fact represents the liquidity provided by market participants during the day. While both models closely resemble the real market, the explicit model slightly overestimates the volumes (as shown also in Figure 5).\r\n\r\nFigure 8 shows the average depth of limit orders, for BID orders (blue dots) and ASK orders (orange dots). The chart shows how the explicit model closely resembles the real market data, even if the data have slightly less variance. Instead, the CGAN model only partially matches the real data: it shows a narrow data distribution, with most of the depths close to zero.\r\n\r\nFigure 9 shows the market spread (see Eq. 5) over the day. The green dots represent the average spread in the real and simulated markets, and the filled area shows the 5th and 95th percentile values. The CGAN model has the best performance, it closely replicates the real market behavior, while the explicit model shows a slight adaptation problem to real market data. When first employed in the market at 10:00 (after the market is initialized with real data), the explicit model doubles the market spread, which decreases and stabilizes only after 12:00.\r\n\r\nFinally, we show an example of the generated time-series in Figure 10. The charts show the normalized mid-price: the left chart shows the real samples, the middle chart shows the explicit model mid-prices, and the right chart shows the CGAN model ones. Both models shows promising diverse and realistic time-series data.\r\n\r\n### Training on different stocks\r\nWe now discuss how our models apply to different stocks. Figure 11 shows the orders generated by the explicit and CGAN model for three different stocks, namely CNR, AINV and AMZN. The blue bars show the real data distributions, the orange bars show the CGAN synthetic data, and the bars with red lines outline the explicit model synthetic data (we use empty bars to improve readability). The first two charts show the cancel depth and depth of CNR and AINV orders, respectively. The charts show that both proposed models are able to generate realistic data (i.e., the bars mostly overlap). The last chart shows the depth distribution for AMZN orders. While the CGAN model is able to generate realistic data, the explicit model fails to reproduce the depth of the orders (i.e., it generates only values close to 0).\r\n\r\nThis chart shows the main advantage of the CGAN model: with fewer assumptions on underlying data structure, the model is able to represent a wider range of stocks, with different behaviors and distributions.\r\n\r\n### Responsiveness\r\nResponsiveness to exogenous orders is a desirable property of artificial market models, and it allows to investigate the impact of a strategy on the market. To evaluate the responsiveness of our models, we study the price impact caused by an experimental Percent-Of-Volume (POV) agent [1,6]. This agent submits a burst of buy/sell orders within a limited time window (e.g., 30 minutes) to buy/sell a target amount of shares. This target amount is a percentage λ ∈ (0,1] of the total transacted volume in the history, for the same time window.\r\n\r\nFigure 12 shows the simulated market with the λ-POV agent, with λ ∈ [0.1,0.2,0.5]. The agent acts only in a time window of 30 minutes, between 10:30 and 11:00 (gray area in the charts). The charts show the market impact as the normalized mid-price difference between the simulation with and without the experimental agent. The results average 25 different runs: the black line shows the average mid-price difference; the gray shaded region represents one standard deviation; and the red lines represent the 5-th and 95-th percentile. The left charts show the explicit model, while the right charts show the CGAN-based model.\r\n\r\nBoth models exhibit the price impact, i.e., the burst of buy trades at 10:30 causes prices to rise, showing a substantial deviation w.r.t. the mid-price in the simulation without the experimental agent. The greater the value of λ, the higher the impact on the price. In particular, the average mid-price difference in the CGAN model with λ = 0.1 (top right chart) reaches the 0.5%, while with λ = 0.5 (bottom right chart) it increases over the 1%. With λ ∈ [0.1,0.2] the CGAN model also shows a mean-reversion to the average price, after the price impact. The mean-reversion effects are weaker for the explicit model, and the price does not return to its average value. With λ = 0.5 (bottom charts) the experimental agent alters the price trend permanently, i.e., the prices do not return to their average levels. In summary, the observed market impact and price reversion phenomena that arise in simulation, using our world agent approaches, are consistent with observations of the real market [2].\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\nIn this paper we introduced a world model simulator to ease financial simulation, and improve realism and responsiveness. We proposed two approaches to the world model based on a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN), and a mixture of parametric distributions. We proved that our world models can learn to simulate realistic markets once trained on historical data, without the need of access to individual and proprietary strategies. We also demonstrated that our models improve previous state-of-art solutions, providing more realistic simulation.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- Coletta, A., Moulin, A., Vyetrenko, S., & Balch, T.

Rough volatility models also generate a local volatility surface, via the so-called Markovian projection of the stochastic volatility. We complement the existing results on implied volatility by studying the asymptotic behavior of the local volatility surface generated by a class of rough stochastic volatility models, encompassing the rough Bergomi model. Notably, we observe that the celebrated \"1/2 skew rule\" linking the short-term at-the-money skew of the implied volatility to the short-term at-the-money skew of the local volatility, a consequence of the celebrated \"harmonic mean formula\" of [Berestycki, Busca, and Florent, QF 2002], is replaced by a new rule: the ratio of the at-the-money implied and local volatility skews tends to the constant 1/(H+3/2) (as opposed to the constant 1/2), where H is the regularity index of the underlying instantaneous volatility process.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nIn rough stochastic volatility models, volatility is driven by a fractional noise, in the rough regime of Hurst parameter H less than 1/2. With no claim of completeness, we mention econometric evidence [45, 40, 15], market microstructure foundations [26], efficient numerical methods and simulations schemes [11, 14, 58, 27], including deep learning algorithms [13, 47].\r\n\r\nThis work is concerned with pricing under rough volatility, a key feature of which, well-adapted to the steep volatility skews seen in Equity option markets, is the power-law behavior of the short-dated at-the-money (ATM) implied volatility skew:\r\n\r\n$$S_{BS} \\sim (\\const)t^{H-1/2}$$\r\n\r\nreferences include [3, 37, 6, 8, 28, 25, 38, 32, 49, 39, 12]. More specifically, we consider here - to the best of our knowledge for the first time - the Dupire local volatility [24, 23] generated by rough volatility models, using a Gyongy-type projection [51, 18] and study its short-time behavior in a large deviations regime. In the context of implied volatility, such a regime was pioneered in [28], with instantaneous stochastic volatility process given as v(t,ω) = σ(W^H_t (ω)), i.e., as some explicit function of a fractional Brownian motion (fBm). In particular, no rough or Volterra stochastic differential equations need to be solved. We shall work under the same structural assumption as [28], although under less restrictive growth assumptions, such as to include the popular rough Bergomi model where σ has exponential form.\r\n\r\nPostponing detailed recalls and precise definitions, our main result (Theorem 3.3) states that,\r\n\r\n$$\\sigma_{loc}(t, y t^{1/2-H}) \\to \\sigma(\\hat{h}_y^1) \\ast \\downarrow 0,$$\r\n\r\nwhere ˆh_y is related to a minimization problem, similar to a geodesic in Riemannian geometry. Our analytic understanding is sufficiently fine to exploit it on the one hand for numerical tests (discussed in Section 4) and on the other hand to derive further analytic results (formulated in Sections 2 and 3, with proofs left to Section 5) including the blowup, when H < 1/2, of the local volatility skew in the short-dated limit,\r\n\r\n$$S_{loc} \\sim (\\const)t^{H-1/2},$$\r\n\r\nsee Corollary 3.4 below for a precise statement and information on the constant. This finding is consistent with [38] where it is shown, amongst others, that in \"regular\" local-stochastic vol models, which amounts to a regularity assumption on σ_loc, the implied volatility skew does not explode. The regularity of σ_loc is violated here in the sense that S_loc is infinite at t = 0. This is also consistent with [60, 36] where it is shown that a \"singular\" σ_loc can indeed produce exploding implied skews.\r\n\r\nA further interesting consequence, also part of Corollary 3.4, is then that the 1/2-rule of thumb from practitioners [22] (see also [43] and [39, Remark 3.4] for different proofs) actually fails and is replaced, again in the short-dated limit, by what we may call the 1/(H+3/2)-rule,\r\n\r\n$$S_{BS} / S_{loc} \\to 1/(H+3/2).$$\r\n\r\nAs a sanity check, for Hurst parameter H = 1/2 we are in a diffusive regime and then indeed fall back to the 1/2-rule.\r\n\r\n## The modeling framework\r\nWe assume S_0 = 1 and that the log price X_t := log S_t satisfies\r\n\r\n$$dX_t = -1/2 V_t dt + \\sqrt{V_t} (\\rho dW_t + \\rho dW_t)$$\r\n\r\nV_t = σ^2(W^H_t)\r\n\r\nwith 'volatility function' σ: R → R. We shall assume σ to be smooth, subject to mild growth conditions given below, such as to cover rough Bergomi type situations where σ(x) = σ_0 exp(ηx).\r\n\r\n### Assumption 2.1\r\nThere exist c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 > 0 such that for all x ∈ R,\r\n\r\n$$c_1 e^{-c_2 |x|} \\leq \\sigma(x),$$\r\n\r\n$$\\sigma(x) \\leq c_3 e^{c_4 |x|}.$$\r\n\r\nWe take ρ^2 + ρ^2 = 1, with ρ ∈ (-1,1). We denote W = (W, W) where W, W are two independent standard Brownian motions. These are used to construct W^H_t = (K * ˙W)_t, with\r\n\r\n$$K(t,s) = \\sqrt{2H}(t-s)^{H-1/2} \\mathbf{1}_{t>s}$$\r\n\r\nso that W^H is a Riemann–Liouville fBm with Hurst index H ≤ 1/2.\r\n\r\n## Mathematical setting and results\r\nThe time-scaling property of the Gaussian process (W, W, W^H) underlying the model (2.1) yields X^ε_2 law = X^ε_1 for every ε > 0, where X^ε_1 satisfies\r\n\r\n$$X^ε_1 = \\int_1^0 σ(ε^{2H} W^H_s) ε ds (ρ dW_s + ρ dW_s) - 1/2 ε^2 \\int_1^0 σ^2(ε^{2H} W^H_s) ds.$$\r\n\r\nForde and Zhang proved in [28], albeit under different technical conditions on the volatility function, that a small noise Large Deviation Principle (LDP) holds for the family ε^{2H-1} X^ε_1 (hence for ε^{2H-1} X^ε_2) as ε → 0, with speed ε^{4H} and rate function\r\n\r\n$$Λ(y) := \\inf_{h=(h,h) \\in H_1} \\{1/2 \\|h\\|_{H_1}^2 : \\int_t^0 σ(\\hat{h}_s) (ρ dh_s + ρ dh_s) = y\\} = 1/2 \\|h_y\\|_{H_1}^2,$$\r\n\r\nwhere h_y is a minimizer of the control problem defining Λ(y). From the LDP (3.2), we have\r\n\r\n$$-ε^{4H} \\log P(X^ε_1 \\geq y ε^{1-2H}) \\to Λ(y) = 1/2 \\|h_y\\|_{H_1}^2, y > 0 as ε ↓ 0,$$\r\n\r\n$$-ε^{4H} \\log P(X^ε_1 \\leq y ε^{1-2H}) \\to Λ(y) = 1/2 \\|h_y\\|_{H_1}^2, y < 0 as ε ↓ 0.$$\r\n\r\nThe short-time result for call and put prices reads as follows (see [28, Corollary 4.13])\r\n\r\n$$-t^{2H} \\log E[(e^{X_t} - e^{y t^{1/2-H}})^+] \\to Λ(y) = 1/2 \\|h_y\\|_{H_1}^2, y > 0 as t ↓ 0,$$\r\n\r\n$$-t^{2H} \\log E[(e^{y t^{1/2-H}} - e^{X_t})^+] \\to Λ(y) = 1/2 \\|h_y\\|_{H_1}^2, y < 0 as t ↓ 0.$$\r\n\r\nLet us also recall that these option price asymptotics imply the following asymptotic formula for the Black–Scholes implied volatility (notation: σ_BS), which can be seen as a \"rough\" version of the Berestycki–Buscat–Florent (BBF) formula [17]:\r\n\r\n$$σ_{BS}^2 (t, y t^{1/2-H}) \\to χ^2(y) := y^2 / (2Λ(y)), y \\neq 0 as t ↓ 0.$$\r\n\r\n## Markovian projection at the LDP regime\r\nThe Markovian projection of the instantaneous variance V_t within the model (2.1) is defined by\r\n\r\n$$σ_{loc}^2 (t,k) := E[V_t | X_t = k]$$\r\n\r\nfor every t > 0 and k ∈ R.\r\n\r\nWe now present our main result. We prove that the local volatility function (3.8) satisfies the following short-time asymptotics.\r\n\r\n### Theorem 3.3 (Markovian projection at the LDP regime)\r\nLet Assumption 2.1 be in force. Then, the Markovian projection in the model (2.1) satisfies, for every y ∈ R\\{0} small enough,\r\n\r\n$$σ_{loc}^2 (t, y t^{1/2-H}) \\to σ^2 (\\hat{h}_y^1) as t ↓ 0,$$\r\n\r\nwhere we recall that \\hat{h}_y^t = \\int_t^0 K(t,s) dh_y^s and h_y = (h_y, h_y) is the minimizer of the rate function in (3.2).\r\n\r\n## Local volatility skew and the new 1/(H+3/2) rule\r\nLet us write ∼ for asymptotic equivalence as t → 0. Let us denote Σ(y) := σ(\\hat{h}_y^1) the limiting function in (3.9), and consider the following finite-difference approximations of the local and implied volatility skew\r\n\r\n$$S_{loc}(t,y) := \\frac{σ_{loc}(t, y t^{1/2-H}) - σ_{loc}(t, -y t^{1/2-H})}{2 y t^{1/2-H}},$$\r\n\r\n$$S_{BS}(t,y) := \\frac{σ_{BS}(t, y t^{1/2-H}) - σ_{BS}(t, -y t^{1/2-H})}{2 y t^{1/2-H}}.$$\r\n\r\nThen, we have the following\r\n\r\n### Corollary 3.4 (Local vol skew and the new 1/(H+3/2) rule)\r\nLet ρ ≠ 0. Let Assumption 2.1 be in force. Then, for y ∈ R\\{0} small enough,\r\n\r\n$$S_{loc}(t,y) ∼ \\frac{Σ(y) - Σ(-y)}{2y} \\frac{1}{t^{1/2-H}} as t → 0.$$\r\n\r\nUnder the additional moment condition in Assumption 3.2,\r\n\r\n$$S_{BS}(t,y) / S_{loc}(t,y) \\to \\frac{1}{H+3/2} as t → 0.$$\r\n\r\nIn the case ρ = 0, we have S_BS(t,y) = 0 and S_loc(t,y) = 0 for every t.\r\n\r\n## Numerical tests\r\nWe wish to estimate the conditional expectation (3.8) for some specific instance of the model (2.1), using Monte Carlo simulation. We consider the rough Bergomi model [6], for which the instantaneous variance process is given by\r\n\r\n$$V_t = ξ_0 \\exp(η W^H_t - η^2/2 t^{2H})$$\r\n\r\nwhere ξ_0 = V_0 is the spot variance and η a parameter that tunes the volatility of variance.\r\n\r\nFor a given time horizon T > 0 and a number N ∈ N^* of time-steps, the random vector (log V_t_k)_{1≤k≤N}, t_k = k T/N, has a multivariate Gaussian distribution with known mean and variance, see for example [6], and can therefore be simulated exactly. We use the standard simulation method for Gaussian vectors based on a Cholesky factorization of the covariance matrix.\r\n\r\nWe construct approximate samples of the log-asset price X_T = -1/2 ∫_T^0 V_t dt + ∫_T^0 √V_t (ρ dW_t + ρ dW_t) using a forward Euler scheme on the same time-grid.\r\n\r\nWe use M = 1.5 × 10^6 Monte Carlo samples and N = 500 discretization points.\r\n\r\n### Remark 4.1\r\nSeveral recent works [10, 9, 42, 30] study the weak error rate of rough Bergomi type models. Without going into (bibliographical) details, the weak rate has now been identified as 1 for H above 1/6 and 3H + 1/2 for H below 1/6. Importantly, as H ↓ 0, a weak rate of 1/2 persists. The fairly large number of time steps we considered in our experiments (N = 500) is arguably enough to obtain good benchmark values when H is close to 1/2, but we should bear in mind that the bias in the Monte Carlo estimation is expected to become more and more important as H approaches zero. In this case, larger number of time steps might be required to get a trustworthy level of accuracy; of course, the complexity of the exact Cholesky method we exploited in our simulation of the Riemann–Liouville process makes the simulations very demanding for very large values of N.\r\n\r\n## Short-dated local volatility\r\nTheorem 3.3 gives the asymptotic behavior of σ_loc(t, y t^{1/2-H}) as t becomes small. Since y is allowed to vary around the at-the-money point y = 0, we can check whether the limit (3.9) holds for the function y ↦ ˆσ_loc(t,y) := σ_loc(t, y t^{1/2-H}), that is the whole local volatility smile rescaled with maturity.\r\n\r\nThe computation of the limiting function σ(\\hat{h}_y^1) requires us to evaluate the Cameron-Martin path h_y ∈ H_1 that minimizes the rate function in (3.2), for given y. We follow the procedure already exploited in [28] and [32, section 5.1]: it can be shown, see [28], that the rate function satisfies the alternative representation Λ(y) = inf { (y - ρ G(h))^2 / (2ρ^2 F(h)) + 1/2 ⟨˙h, ˙h⟩ : ˙h ∈ L^2(0,1) }, with F(h) = ⟨σ^2(\\hat{h}), 1⟩ = ∫_1^0 σ^2(\\hat{h}_t) dt and G(h) = ⟨σ(\\hat{h}), ˙h⟩ = ∫_1^0 σ(\\hat{h}_t) ˙h_t dt. This alternative representation yields the rate function under the form of an unconstrained optimization problem (as opposed to the constrained optimization in (3.2)), which can then be approximately solved by the projection of the one-dimensional path h over an orthonormal basis {˙e_n}_{n≥1} of L^2,\r\n\r\n˙h_t = ∑_{n≥1} a_n ˙e_n(t).\r\n\r\nIn practice, we truncate the sum at a certain order N and minimize over the coefficients (a_n)_{1≤n≤N}; we obtain an approximation of the minimizer h_y and therefore of \\hat{h}_y^t = (K^H * ˙h_y)_t = ∫_t^0 K(t,s) ˙h_y^s ds. We chose the Fourier basis {˙e_1(t) = 1, ˙e_2n(t) = √2 cos(2πnt), ˙e_2n+1(t) = √2 sin(2πnt), n ∈ N\\{0}} in our experiments, and observed that truncation of the sum at N = 8 provides a good accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe results for the rough Bergomi model are displayed in Figure 3, where the function ˆσ_loc(t,y) is indeed seen to approach its limit σ(\\hat{h}_y^1) when maturity decreases from T = 0.5 to T = 0.05. The residual error term ˆσ_loc(t,y) - σ(\\hat{h}_y^1) is seen to depend on H, with lower values of H being associated with higher errors. It is however unclear whether the error for H = 0.1 is due to the slow convergence of ˆσ_loc or the weak error rate due to the Monte Carlo simulation (see Remark 4.1).\r\n\r\n## Extrapolation of local volatility surfaces\r\nTheorem 3.3 provides us with an extrapolation recipe of local volatilities for very short maturities: fixing a (small) maturity T and a log-moneyness level k, formally plugging y = k / T^{1/2-H} in (3.9) we obtain\r\n\r\n$$σ_{loc}(T, k) ≈ σ(\\hat{h}_y^1) |_{y = k / T^{1/2-H}}.$$\r\n\r\nThe limiting function σ(\\hat{h}_y^1) |_{y = k / T^{1/2-H}} can therefore be used to extrapolate a local volatility surface in a way that is consistent with the behavior implied by a rough volatility model.\r\n\r\nAs a specific application, consider the calibration of a local-stochastic volatility model (LSV) to an option price surface, for example using the particle method of Guyon and Henry-Labordère [50]. The LSV model calibrated to a given Dupire local volatility surface σ_Dup, corresponds to (see [50])\r\n\r\n$$l(t,S_t) = \\frac{σ_{Dup}(t,S_t)}{\\sqrt{E[V_t | S_t]}}.$$\r\n\r\nIn general, one wishes the leverage function l(t,·) to be a small correction to the original stochastic volatility model (in other words: as close as possible to l ≡ 1). In practice, the local volatility σ_Dup coming from market data has to be extrapolated for values of t smaller than the shorter observed maturity, and the choice of the extrapolation method is up to the user. If, for small t, the chosen extrapolation σ_Dup(t,K) is qualitatively too different from the behavior of the conditional expectation E[V_t | S_t = K] in the rough volatility setting (for example, more specifically: the ATM skew of σ_Dup is far from the power law (3.12)), then the leverage function will have to compensate, hence deviating from the unit function. Under the pure rough volatility model (l ≡ 1), Theorem 3.3 and Corollary 3.4 describe the behavior of the Markovian projection E[V_t | S_t] for small t: eventually, these statements give hints on how σ_Dup(t,·) should be extrapolated for l(t,·) not to deviate too much from the unit function. Such an extrapolation scheme is exploited in the recent work of Dall'Acqua, Longoni and Pallavicini [19], precisely in order to calibrate a LSV model with lifted Heston [1] backbone to the implied volatility surface of the EuroStoxx50 index.\r\n\r\n## Failure of the harmonic mean asymptotic formula under rough volatility\r\nIn Remark 3.7, we pointed out that, as a consequence of the general 1/(H+3/2) skew rule (as opposed to the 1/2 rule) in Corollary 3.4, the harmonic mean asymptotic formula σ_BS(T,k) ∼ H(T,k) as T → 0, see (3.16), is expected not to hold for H ≠ 1/2 (without any contradiction with the statements in [16], which require regularity conditions on local volatility surface that are not satisfied in the rough volatility setting, see our discussion in Remark 3.7). In other words, we do not expect the harmonic mean of the local volatility H(T,k) = 1/(1/k ∫_k^0 dy σ_loc(T,y)) to be a good approximation of the implied volatility smile when maturities become small when the involved volatility surfaces are generated by a rough vol model. Having constructed estimators (4.3) and (4.4) of the local volatility function under the rough Bergomi model, we are also able to approximate (with an additional deterministic quadrature) the harmonic mean H(T,k), and compare the output with the implied volatility smile.\r\n\r\nThe results are shown in Figure 4, for three different values of H. As expected, when H = 0.5 we observe (upper left panel) that the implied volatility σ_BS(T,k) approaches the harmonic mean H(T,k) when maturity decreases from T = 0.45 to T = 0.05, and the at-the-money slopes are also seen to agree. The convergence is even more apparent in the upper right figure, where the ratio σ_BS(T,k)/H(T,k) is seen to monotonically converge to one. This behavior should be compared with the one in the two bottom figures, where the rough case H = 0.1 is considered (the case H = 0.3 being intermediate between the other two): now, when maturity decreases, the implied volatility smile does not seem to approach the harmonic mean H(T,k) anymore (apart from the specific at-the-money point k = 0 where both functions tend to the initial spot volatility σ_0 = √V_0), and in particular, the slopes of the two curves are seen to considerably deviate from each other. This phenomenon is even more clear in the bottom right figure, where the ratio σ_BS(T,k)/H(T,k) has a completely different behavior with respect to the diffusive case H = 0.5.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- Bourgey, F., De Marco, S., Friz, P.
