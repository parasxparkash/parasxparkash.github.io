Most days I catch myself wondering: am I really living, or just wasting time?
It’s uncomfortable to admit, but too often I’m simply passing hours instead of living moments. I tell myself, “I’ll start tomorrow.” I chase comfort. I fill the silence with distractions — noise, scrolling, random consumption — anything that numbs me from asking the deeper question: what am I actually doing with my time?

## The Stoic warning

The Stoics warned us about this exact trap. They weren’t writing from ivory towers. They were human beings who wrestled with procrastination, fear, comfort, and self-deception — just like we do today.

Seneca wrote: “It’s not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it.” That line stings every time I revisit it. It makes me pause and measure my days: how much of my time is truly lived, and how much is just wasted?

## Four rules that keep me anchored

- **Memento Mori — remember you’re going to die.**  
  Death is the ultimate reminder. Everything I postpone, everything I avoid, everything I keep telling myself I’ll do “someday” — death wipes that away. Life is finite; I forget that too often.

- **Choose discomfort over comfort.**  
  Comfort feels sweet, but it’s a slow poison. Real growth lives on the other side of discomfort — training the body, disciplining the mind, having difficult conversations, building something that matters. Comfort whispers, “Rest a little longer,” but it quietly steals from me.

- **Stop lying to yourself.**  
  The small lies are the most dangerous: “I’ll start later.” “This isn’t so bad.” “I deserve a break.” They pile up until they become belief. Marcus Aurelius wrote, “If it is not true, do not say it. If it is not right, do not do it.” That includes the lies I feed myself.

- **Do the work in silence.**  
  Not everything needs to be announced, shared, or validated. Marcus wrote Meditations for himself. The point isn’t recognition — it’s discipline and action: doing the thing because it matters, not because anyone is watching.

## Comfort is the hardest

Comfort disguises itself as rest, but rarely gives real rest. True rest rejuvenates. Comfort drains slowly and quietly. Hours of scrolling, eating out of boredom, distracting myself with nonsense — it feels harmless, but I end up emptier than before.

## The question I return to

Am I living — or slowly being lulled into wasting what little time I have?

I don’t always know. Some days I win. Some days I slip. But these rules — death, discomfort, honesty, and silent work — pull me back. Life isn’t waiting for the perfect day, the perfect energy, the perfect mindset. Life is choosing to live right now.

And maybe that’s the real work: to wake up, stop numbing, and step into the day knowing time is the one thing I can’t afford to lose.
